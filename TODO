LOTS TO WORK ON
---------------
Languages are complicated.

UNSORTED NEW ISSUES

cms requirements(ideas only)
  - get_content (page [, section [, user]] )
  - set_content( page [, section [, user]][, template] )
  - get_static_content( file ) - must supply id/class/both
  - set_static_content( file )
  - get_content_param( name )
  - set_content_param( name, value )
  - login system

[forked jobs in a pipeline aren't logging out because they think they
are in a login shell, in a login shell]
[src/spar was not recognized as a command...looked for 'src']
[--profile - profile but do not make a login session]
[annotations should be able to take a team member as an author]
[csrf example - this is a random token stored in the user's session,
changing each request  It is encoded as base64 just to make it
compatible with HTML - numerics.md5( strings.image( numerics.rnd( 100000000 ) ) ) - the md5 is just to make it HTML compatible]
[add category to annotations]
Cmp. http://www.adapower.com/adapower1/alg/base64.html

[David B wants shared library but didn't get it added in time]

[Empty bareword treated as a parameter but shouldn't be]
[check double import test case]
[close tinyserve if open]
[complete tinyserve package]
[pragma test_result - output in JUNIT format?]
[need template package to set return HTTP status]
[check pragma block with @ ]
[allow users to create their own universal types]
[record system refactor (in prep for aggregate expressions)]
[blocks still allow declarations in executable section, even in formal mode - see distance examples
This is probably because blocks use ParseGeneralStatement.  We need a more restrictive form of
ParseGeneralStatement]
[constant records are permitted but the fields are variables...the fields should all be constants]
[with include doesn't work on the command because it is loaded at syntax check time and the
command line has no syntax check...but it would be good to load libraries at the command line
so can I come up with a strategy to make it work?]

IDEAS

- SELinux-like ability to control who access what.
  - for any function, restrict it to a list of parent functions which
    may call it.
  - for any command, restrict it to a list of parent functions which
    may call it.
  - objects more complicated but not an issue now.
  - have an option for open access
  - how to you lock the list and enforce it?

ISSUES (SparForte Environment)

  * build system (SparForte Environment)

  * regression test suite (SparForte Environemnt)
    - break up good test into lesser tests (just too many for debugging
      when there's a new error in the middle after massive changes)
    - should test in-line for with ada and shell statements
    - test upper ASCII escaped characters
    - new string functions: neg tests
    - for loops no longer confused by older vars of same name - neg test
    - test suite test for var existence after declare block end, array & itself,
      array casts, array subtypes, array default assignments, cmdline redirect &
      restricted shells, -e, in / not in operator, unchecked_import tests in
      test suite
    - command line redirection tests in testsuite
    - to_upper, to_lower, to_proper, to_basic, to_escaped, is_typo_of
    - numerics.odd, numerics.even
    - files.is_executable, files.is_readable, files.is_writable,
      files.last_modified need positive and negative tests
    - tests for large numbers of open/close to make sure we don't run out
      file descriptors because of improper closures
    - changes to allow for "i : integer := i" not tested for arrays...that is,
      values being assigned to arrays probably can't contain the same name as
      the array.  See ParseDeclarationPart for how to handle this.
  - dir_separator, change_dir, remove_dir, get_current_dir, dir_name,
    base_name, file_extension, file_name, format_pathname, expand_path & test
  - enum package neg tests
  - is separate tests

  * sample programs
    - update the sample programs for subprograms
    - in morph.bush example, a single newline is output when Ada is shutting
      down.  Is something flushed or what??...BUT a short sample script doesn't
      have this behaviour.  Is this still an issue?

ISSUES (AdaScript)

  * latest
    - SOCK_NONBLOCK - obsolete in Linux, must be replaced
    - rpmlint complains about gethostbyname (IP4-specific) -> getaddrinfo


  * general syntax (AdaScript Issues)
    - implement scientific notation numeric literals
    - implement overloadable enumerateds
    - implement attributes (will need to change byte code compiler)
    - do not allow declarations between begin..end in a begin block
    - a range could be a new class.  That would allow arrays.range and a general
      parseRange
    - enumerateds should be upper-case, if this doesn't conflict with type-
      sensitivity
    - byte code changed to support more compressed reserved words
    - vim syntax - $$ doesn't work
    - unreachable code error doesn't indent token hilight properly

  * assignments
    - naturals and positives compatibility (intTypesOK) not handled at
      assignment

  * pen package (AdaScript Issues)
    - pen package fails on AMD/Linux
    - pen package fails on FreeBSD with SDL/SVGALIB (interfers with Spar
      keyboard/mouse/display functions)
    - deferred picture load
    - locking issues
    - null_rect, all_rect
    - SDL/OpenGL binding

  * database packages (AdaScript Issues)
    - select statements should be pipeline-able (probably fails because the
      child process closes database socket when the APQ library quits)
    - db.schema can result in an error error
    - db.users and related information procedures should be builtin commands
      so they can be pipelined (ie. so "| less" can be used)
    - turning off formatting in pipelines or redirection (especially SQL
      commands which are unusable in wide layout format)
    - \ at end of line will cause an error on SQL statements
    - a database connection pool
    - use ligda (GNU data access) for portable data needs?

  * Text_IO package (AdaScript issues)
    - enumerated subtypes - put_line / ? do not print the correct enum item
    - set input/output/error cannot be redirected to an file_type in an array
    - get_line doesn't strip ASCII.CR like I thought
    - should "?" should trim strings?
    - close with no filename could close all open user files (ala BASIC,
      convenient for scripts)
    - output numbers with alternative bases
    - Allow standard output, etc. to be closed.  (We dup them anyway.)
    -   Does scanner reset cause Current_Output/etc. to be double dup()'ed
    - line count for a file doesn't work if put_line doesn't include the file
      variable or if it's a built-in file (standard_output, current_output,
      etc.)
    - managing files like types, by negotiating and have spar provide a
      recommended handle.  This would make the language more cloud-ready.
      e.g. type <filehandle> for <type> range <1..num_records>... to
      return a file handle on a device that meets these size requirements,
      whether in memory, on a hard drive, etc.  Similarily, specify if it needs
      to be fast, indexed, etc.  The architect could specify the options.

  * TCP/IP client sockets
    - "file /= eof_t" is wrong: standard_input could be specified explicitly
    - linux socket calls in bush_linux
    - set_output, etc. redirection for sockets
    - optimize fd - don't need to pull it out with stringField for every DoGet

  * command_line package (AdaScript issues)
    - command_line.argument() cannot be used in open...get an error.  Expects
      a type not a keyword...why?
    - implement gnat command_line

  * enumerated types
    - enumerateds are declare as constants of the enumerated type BUT if the
      user declares a constant of the enumerated type (a rare occurrence) it
      will be treated as an item of the enumerated type instead of a constant
      so there needs to be a symbol table flag to identify enumerated items.

  * sound package (AdaScript issues)
    - sound.mute, sound.unmute
    - Wavplay doesn't recover gracefully from errors...need to reset defaults
      especially after an error

  * strings package (AdaScript issues)
    - strings.replace_match/glob
    - strings.cvs - comma separated values - 2, 3, "hello", ... fields

  * files package (AdaScript Issues)
    - should it handle ~?
    - should restricted shell affect?

  * calendar package (AdaScript Issues)
    - to_julian / to_time not working

  * System package (AdaScript Issues)
    - System_Name should be enumerated

  * template issues (AdaScript Issues)
    - line numbering in templates - Text_IO skips blank lines.  Template
      scripts are missing blank lines, and throws line numbers off as a
      result.  May have to go with sequential I/O or UNIX file reading.

  * subprograms (AdaScript Issues)
    - parseFunction/ProcedureCallSemicolon requires rewriting parseGeneralStatement (that is, not one expect( ; ) for all general statements)
    - expressions should be able to return records and arrays
      - functions should be able to return records and arrays
    - forward procedures broken (commented out in tests) - params are broke
      when expecting forward subprogram
    - out and in out parameter types in user-defined procedures

  * command types (AdaScript Issues)
      - can command types be implemented using appropriate pragmas
        instead of a special type (ie. pragma command (strvar) );?
   - command vars should be &-able with backquotes.

  * Ada package bindings
    - switch to Ada's CGI from David Wheeler's CGI package
    - binding to: Gnat.Directory_Operations
    - thick binding to: Gnat.Os_Lib
    - binding to: Byte_IO (sequential)

  - aggregates (AdaScript Issues)
    - arrays probably won't work as parameters to user-defined subprograms
    - errors when expecting scalars
    - assigning records to records
    - unsetting records
    - string should be an array type, but they are not arrays in the bush sense
    - ideally, unbounded_strings should not be a subtype of universal strings
      for compatibility with Ada 95.  As a result, an unbounded_string typecast
      shouldn't work but it does in AdaScript.
    - unconstrained arrays and forced initialization
    - if array return values are implemented, arrays should be initialized with
      array expression value.

ISSUES (Bourne Shell)

  - redirections (Shell Issues)
    - advanced job control (control-Z, fg, bg, etc.)
    - 2>&1 doesn't work...2>, 2>>, >, >> work OK
    - pipelines not allowed after 2>&1
    - errors in `..` backquotes don't terminate script - may be fixed
    - errors in `..` don't show outer script line number
    - line numbers and procedures: if an error occurs, the line number is not
      the line number of the procedure but where the procedure was called plus
      the offset into the procedure

  - job control (Shell Issues)
    - check sig child flag after every general statement (already done?)
    - single user mode detection, disabling job control
    - SIGHUP handler: SIGHUP should be broadcast to all children like BASH

  - other shell issues (Shell Issues)
    - SHELL variable doesn't always initialize to spar command path
    - pragma to disable emacs or vi mode
    - collating order with file globbing and locales
    - remove dependency on Ada.Command_Line.Environment -- not supported in Windows GNAT
    - an error terminates all commands in an interactive semi-colon list, but
      it should continue on for POSIX compatibility.  Is this resolvable?
    - because terminal attributes are toggled on and off, slow systems
      sometimes echo characters during input, throwing off the display
    - prompt script: final cr being ignored because it users compileandrun
      proc.
    - pathname completion "/" and " " append tests should use stat(), not
      Text_IO and GNAT Dir Ops.  Perhaps another c_os function??
    - insert sometimes inserts characters wrong in the command line.  Backing
      up, deleting and retyping is OK, but cursoring over and changing
      sometimes doesn't keep line position properly. Still an issue?
    - @ works with procedures (but not with shell commands yet): the shell
      command identifiers might be a path "/bin/ls" or if command is an
      identifier($command if) will it still work?
      - should be its own identifier...maybe comma, too, to simplify code
      - document
   - environment problems: using putenv removes the variable from the
     environment but GNAT's command_line package still looks for it and
     returns a garbage value for that environment entry (as if it caches the
     environment)
   - now that the initial environment is loaded at scanner startup, there may
     be environment issues...haven't thought it through
   - hash clash in pipeline for builtin--this might be fixed, confirm
   - Bourne shell compatibility and syntax checking: declaring variables in
     statements.  Is it worth it?  Example:
       while i < 2 loop
         if i = 0 then
           j : integer;
         end if;
       end loop;
    doesn't work since declarations are always done even if skipped because
    the symbols need to be in the symbol table when walking through the
    syntax even when the statements aren't being executed.  This is a rare
    case, but it also raises the issue of scope with pullBlock--technically,
    j is a global but pullBlock treats all internal declarations as local.


MAJOR REDESIGNS

  - architecture
    - pragmas for business architecture.  e.g. pragma licence (gpl),
      pragma license_limit_instances( 15 ), pragam license_limit_users( 12 )
  - redesigning the symbol table to handle non-string values
    - allows byte_io package based on sequential_io
    - implement use clause
    - multi-dimensional arrays
    - records should allow nested arrays
    - arrays should support nested arrays
    - linked lists or other container types

 - exception handling
    - rewrite parser so that err doesn't set eof_t (ie have loops that look
      for eof also look for error_found)
    - save error message to err_message variable
    - ParseExceptionPart
    - allow raise, don't worry about declaring exceptions until later

 - performance enhancements
    - arrays are very slow
    - lineRead still reads as unbounded_string instead of copying directly
      into script variable, causing double buffering and conversion slowdowns
    - more sophisticated byte code for speed
       - this will require the scanner and parser holding two different tables for
         identifiers (because only the parser knowns what block(s) an identifier
         belongs to).  Otherwise, the existing get_next_token can be used to
         tokenize the script file.
    - change system calls to get tput results - remove system() reliance
    - "kind" field should be a pointer for speed, not an array index
    - no type-checking after syntax-check stage?
    - a pragma inline should be created in order to cache other scripts
    - DoRunTimeStatments should probably fork and use pipes to read results
      instead of using a temp file
      - otherwise, DoRunTimeStatements only read results one char at a time
    - would arrays be faster as real dynamic ada arrays?
    - instead of the fast string library, just store the first character in
      the identifier record and (optionally) test on that?  Use a new record
      type to prevent string assignments without updating the first character.
    - can word_t byte code items also contain a trailing "pattern" as well as
      "word"
    - .list and .FieldOf can be combined as .Owner of aggregate sub item, where
      .owner = eof_t indicates a simple variable.  This would simplify the code.
    - review parser/child package structure.  A better way to organize?

  * Platform issues
    - ADAVOX:
      wc-streams-endian.ads:160:04: representation item appears too late
      wc-streams-endian.ads:183:04: representation item appears too late
      on Fedora Core 3 - commented out (for now)
   - Spar hangs with vt52 40x8 login, throws exception (perhaps division by
     zero because attributes like bold null strings??)  Also has ctrl-q's
     so maybe a flow of control problem
