LOTS TO WORK ON
---------------
Languages are complicated...

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
NEW ISSUES

These are new issues identified but not entered into the outstanding bug list
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Severe Issues (Fix These First)
-------------------------------

- exceptions
    - re-raise doesn't work unless it is in the main body of an exception
      handler.  This includes if statements.  Being in an exception handler
      must be a global scanner flag.
- unsorted/misc
    - an early return from the main program doesn't pull the final block,
      even if the template isn't parsed.
    - constant check fails if assignment is in `..` (subscripts are compiled after
      main program is compiled, but are they syntax checked earlier?)  This may be
      part of a greater issue: subscripts should be syntax checked at compile-time.

Annoyances / Bugs with Workarounds / Updates
--------------------------------------------

- btree_io/hash_io
    - negative test btree_io.replace with cursor
    - negative test to ensure subprogram exceptions are not lost to parent
    - json decode backslash good regression tests
    - relative paths not working with bdb environments...research
    - option to throw an exception on missing values (including replace, get, add (existing value)
- memcache/memcache.highread
    - update design to use new resource system
- exceptions
    - what are semantics of throwing an exception in a subscript `...`
    - exceptions that propogate to the top aren't formatted properly in the
      Apache log (single chars means single lines)
- pragmas
    - can't declare two licences or software_models.  This is a problem for a
      redistributable library
    - check double pragma import - test case
- unit testing and teamwork
    - xUnit support for tests (pragma test_result - output in JUNIT format?)
- graphics and sound
  - SDL - hardware accelleration not working with SDL...why not?
  - SDL needs to be upgraded for version 2.0
- type system
  - constant records are permitted but the fields are variables...the fields should all be constants
- build system
  - David B wants me to bring back SparForte shared library
    - shared library calling mechanism and integration with other languages
- shell
    - control-d on a non-login shell can sometimes give a command hash "internal
      error"
    - STILL getting DEVICE_ERROR / interrupted syscall randomly on pipelines with
      my virtual machine, even after repeated audits of all syscalls for handling
      this error.
      Possibly raised internally by Ada.Text_IO and needs to be caught and handled?
      If so, where?
       - echo "test" | head; --raised it
       - echo  | sort | head; -- raised it
      - backquotes and redirections (e.g. `x 2>&1 ;`)  raises an exception

- unsorted/misc

    - control-z handling - fork, send a sleep signal and reset scanner
    - REPL example needs to run in a chroot environment
    - get_line on an out mode file gives bad file descriptor but needs a better
      error message
    - function f(p), p should not be 'already exists' if there is a p in scope
    - docs say strings.trim - trim end is optional, but is required.
    - change pegasock to use bdb format exceptions with filename in message?
    - check pragma block with @ 
    - ParseGeneralStatement allows declarations.  For body and user role blocks,
      we need more restrictive variations of PGS.

Nice to Haves / Missing Functionality
-------------------------------------

- memcache/memcache.highread
    - update functionality to handle records, arrays, etc. like btree_io
    - element as an alias for "get" in memcache, etc.
- generic types
    - subtypes of generic types
- pragmas
    - distinguish types of pragmas, to later separate by block or context
    - a pragma to check for the version of SparForte?  Is it a doc pragma,
      executable or both?
- user role blocks
    - configuration/policy/project <name> ... is separate (not with separate, which isn't
      as specific)
    - more separation of concerns
      - with configuration
      - with policy
      - with project
      - project block
      - QA concerns?
    - some way to determine if a configuration/policy/project should have been loaded.
      perhaps an architectural pragma for same.
- unit testing and teamwork
    - "status board" generation option for oustanding/in-progress work
    - burndown charts option?
    - review Test concept...what other requirements are missing?
- vectors
  - complete vectors package
- tinyserve
  - close tinyserve if open
  - complete tinyserve package
- types and expressions
  - return arrays and records in expressions (requires records revamp)
  - allow users to create their own universal types
  - record system refactor (in prep for aggregate expressions)
- templates
  - need template package to set return HTTP status
- build system
  - dynamic loadable built-in packages
- unsorted/misc
    - alternatives to ParseGeneralStatement more appropriate for executable bodies
    - update dynamic_hash_table functionality to handle records, arrays, etc. like btree_io
    - standardize get_first as first, etc.
    - safety check that a file cannot include itself
    - redundancy and ways of handing command line option
    - enums.last is slow...should be updated for namespaces to improve speed
    - built-in cache - memory or disk?
    - redesign is_writable, etc. so works better.
    - return [when] , raise [when]
    - new examples
       - example program of ramdisk cache
    - GitHub readme.md "badges" (see also shields)
      - you need to be able to point at Jenkins.  A URL to the shields.io site
        containing an embedded URL to your Jenkins to get the data for the
        badge
      - http://shields.io/
      - example - https://github.com/seiyria/c
    - arrays of files / files in records are not implemented but are possible
       - update FirstFileParam, etc., to work with references
       - wasWritten on arrays and records
       - rewrite references to .value to look use utility functions
     - change or alias for consistency: set -> assign, get -> element
     - with include doesn't work on the command because it is loaded at syntax check
       time and the command line has no syntax check...but it would be good to load
       libraries at the command line so can I come up with a strategy to make it work?

New Unique Concepts
-------------------

  - SELinux-like ability to control who access what.
    - for any function, restrict it to a list of parent functions which
      may call it.
    - for any command, restrict it to a list of parent functions which
      may call it.
    - objects more complicated but not an issue now.
    - have an option for open access
    - how to you lock the list and enforce it?
    - % functionality should be extended and made usable in more contexts
       - chould % chain objects methods?  That is, % equals @ + first param?
  - sofware model + archecture
    - allow architects to apply architecture policy to groups of software by the
      software model system.  Explore what needs to be involved.  should the
      software model be exposed through System?  Currently pragmas are applied
      directly to the current program, rather than triggered by pragma
      software_model and applied through some kind of architecture system.
  - units of measure for numerics
    - e.g. distance : integer in "foot", "feet" := 0;
    - should units be pre-defined?  defined in units package?  strings are too
      risky...
  - naming convention
    - what are the naming standards of functions.  e.g. sin(), to_sin(), sin_of()?

KNOWN ISSUES/IDEAS
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
- some of these issue may have been addressed but not removed from this list
  so check if they are still a problem

ISSUES (SparForte Environment)

  * build system (SparForte Environment)

  * regression test suite (SparForte Environemnt)
    - break up good test into lesser tests (just too many for debugging
      when there's a new error in the middle after massive changes)
    - should test in-line for with ada and shell statements
    - test upper ASCII escaped characters
    - new string functions: neg tests
    - for loops no longer confused by older vars of same name - neg test
    - test suite test for var existence after declare block end, array & itself,
      array casts, array subtypes, array default assignments, cmdline redirect &
      restricted shells, -e, in / not in operator, unchecked_import tests in
      test suite
    - command line redirection tests in testsuite
    - files.is_executable, files.is_readable, files.is_writable,
      files.last_modified need negative tests
    - tests for large numbers of open/close to make sure we don't run out
      file descriptors because of improper closures
    - changes to allow for "i : integer := i" not tested for arrays...that is,
      values being assigned to arrays probably can't contain the same name as
      the array.  See ParseDeclarationPart for how to handle this.
  - dir_separator, change_dir, remove_dir, get_current_dir, dir_name,
    base_name, file_extension, file_name, format_pathname, expand_path & test
  - enum package neg tests
  - is separate tests

  * sample programs
    - update the sample programs for subprograms
    - in morph.bush example, a single newline is output when Ada is shutting
      down.  Is something flushed or what??...BUT a short sample script doesn't
      have this behaviour.  Is this still an issue?

ISSUES (AdaScript)

  * latest
    - SOCK_NONBLOCK - obsolete in Linux, must be replaced
    - rpmlint complains about gethostbyname (IP4-specific) -> getaddrinfo
  * terminal control character escaping isn't working on readline prompt
    - bold is turned off temporarily on prompt


  * general syntax (AdaScript Issues)
    - implement scientific notation numeric literals
    - implement overloadable enumerateds
    - implement attributes (will need to change byte code compiler)
    - do not allow declarations between begin..end in a begin block
    - a range could be a new class.  That would allow arrays.range and a general
      parseRange
    - enumerateds should be upper-case, if this doesn't conflict with type-
      sensitivity
    - vim syntax - $$ doesn't work
    - unreachable code error doesn't indent token hilight properly

  * assignments
    - naturals and positives compatibility (intTypesOK) not handled at
      assignment...is this fixed?

  * pen package (AdaScript Issues)
    - pen package fails on AMD/Linux
    - pen package fails on FreeBSD with SDL/SVGALIB (interfers with Spar
      keyboard/mouse/display functions)
    - deferred picture load
    - locking issues
    - null_rect, all_rect
    - SDL/OpenGL binding

  * database packages (AdaScript Issues)
    - select statements should be pipeline-able (probably fails because the
      child process closes database socket when the APQ library quits)
    - db.schema can result in an error error
    - db.users and related information procedures should be builtin commands
      so they can be pipelined (ie. so "| less" can be used)
    - turning off formatting in pipelines or redirection (especially SQL
      commands which are unusable in wide layout format)
    - \ at end of line will cause an error on SQL statements
    - a database connection pool
    - use ligda (GNU data access) for portable data needs?

  * Text_IO package (AdaScript issues)
    - enumerated subtypes - put_line / ? do not print the correct enum item
    - set input/output/error cannot be redirected to an file_type in an array
    - get_line doesn't strip ASCII.CR like I thought
    - should "?" should trim strings?
    - close with no filename could close all open user files (ala BASIC,
      convenient for scripts)
    - output numbers with alternative bases
    - Allow standard output, etc. to be closed.  (We dup them anyway.)
    -   Does scanner reset cause Current_Output/etc. to be double dup()'ed
    - line count for a file doesn't work if put_line doesn't include the file
      variable or if it's a built-in file (standard_output, current_output,
      etc.)
    - managing files like types, by negotiating and have spar provide a
      recommended handle.  This would make the language more cloud-ready.
      e.g. type <filehandle> for <type> range <1..num_records>... to
      return a file handle on a device that meets these size requirements,
      whether in memory, on a hard drive, etc.  Similarily, specify if it needs
      to be fast, indexed, etc.  The architect could specify the options.

  * TCP/IP client sockets
    - "file /= eof_t" is wrong: standard_input could be specified explicitly
    - linux socket calls in bush_linux
    - set_output, etc. redirection for sockets
    - optimize fd - don't need to pull it out with stringField for every DoGet

  * command_line package (AdaScript issues)
    - command_line.argument() cannot be used in open...get an error.  Expects
      a type not a keyword...why?
    - implement gnat command_line

  * enumerated types
    - enumerateds are declare as constants of the enumerated type BUT if the
      user declares a constant of the enumerated type (a rare occurrence) it
      will be treated as an item of the enumerated type instead of a constant
      so there needs to be a symbol table flag to identify enumerated items.

  * sound package (AdaScript issues)
    - sound.mute, sound.unmute
    - Wavplay doesn't recover gracefully from errors...need to reset defaults
      especially after an error

  * strings package (AdaScript issues)
    - strings.replace_match/glob
    - strings.cvs - comma separated values - 2, 3, "hello", ... fields

  * files package (AdaScript Issues)
    - should it handle ~?
    - should restricted shell affect?

  * System package (AdaScript Issues)
    - System_Name should be enumerated

  * template issues (AdaScript Issues)
    - line numbering in templates - Text_IO skips blank lines.  Template
      scripts are missing blank lines, and throws line numbers off as a
      result.  May have to go with sequential I/O or UNIX file reading.

  * subprograms (AdaScript Issues)
    - parseFunction/ProcedureCallSemicolon requires rewriting parseGeneralStatement (that is, not one expect( ; ) for all general statements)
    - expressions should be able to return records and arrays
      - functions should be able to return records and arrays
    - forward procedures broken (commented out in tests) - params are broke
      when expecting forward subprogram

  * command types (AdaScript Issues)
      - can command types be implemented using appropriate pragmas
        instead of a special type (ie. pragma command (strvar) );?
   - command vars should be &-able with backquotes.

  * Ada package bindings
    - thick binding to: Gnat.Os_Lib
    - binding to: Byte_IO (sequential)

  - aggregates (AdaScript Issues)
    - arrays probably won't work as parameters to user-defined subprograms
    - errors when expecting scalars
    - assigning records to records
    - unsetting records
    - string should be an array type, but they are not arrays in the bush sense
    - ideally, unbounded_strings should not be a subtype of universal strings
      for compatibility with Ada 95.  As a result, an unbounded_string typecast
      shouldn't work but it does in AdaScript.
    - unconstrained arrays and forced initialization
    - if array return values are implemented, arrays should be initialized with
      array expression value.

ISSUES (Bourne Shell)

  - x/y command name relative paths
    - ./foobar works as expected
    - dir/foobar doesn't work - it must be quoted
    - foo-bar also doesn't work - it must be quoted
    - the byte code compiler could handle this, creating a shell word...but not break
      other things

  - redirections (Shell Issues)
    - advanced job control (control-Z, fg, bg, etc.)
    - 2>&1 doesn't work...2>, 2>>, >, >> work OK
    - pipelines not allowed after 2>&1
    - errors in `..` backquotes don't terminate script - may be fixed
    - errors in `..` don't show outer script line number
    - line numbers and procedures: if an error occurs, the line number is not
      the line number of the procedure but where the procedure was called plus
      the offset into the procedure

  - job control (Shell Issues)
    - check sig child flag after every general statement (already done?)
    - single user mode detection, disabling job control
    - SIGHUP handler: SIGHUP should be broadcast to all children like BASH

  - other shell issues (Shell Issues)
    - SHELL variable doesn't always initialize to spar command path
    - pragma to disable emacs or vi mode
    - collating order with file globbing and locales
    - remove dependency on Ada.Command_Line.Environment -- not supported in Windows GNAT
    - an error terminates all commands in an interactive semi-colon list, but
      it should continue on for POSIX compatibility.  Is this resolvable?
    - because terminal attributes are toggled on and off, slow systems
      sometimes echo characters during input, throwing off the display
    - prompt script: final cr being ignored because it users compileandrun
      proc.
    - pathname completion "/" and " " append tests should use stat(), not
      Text_IO and GNAT Dir Ops.  Perhaps another c_os function??
    - insert sometimes inserts characters wrong in the command line.  Backing
      up, deleting and retyping is OK, but cursoring over and changing
      sometimes doesn't keep line position properly. Still an issue?
    - @ works with procedures (but not with shell commands yet): the shell
      command identifiers might be a path "/bin/ls" or if command is an
      identifier($command if) will it still work?
      - should be its own identifier...maybe comma, too, to simplify code
      - document
   - environment problems: using putenv removes the variable from the
     environment but GNAT's command_line package still looks for it and
     returns a garbage value for that environment entry (as if it caches the
     environment)
   - now that the initial environment is loaded at scanner startup, there may
     be environment issues...haven't thought it through
   - hash clash in pipeline for builtin--this might be fixed, confirm
   - Bourne shell compatibility and syntax checking: declaring variables in
     statements.  Is it worth it?  Example:
       while i < 2 loop
         if i = 0 then
           j : integer;
         end if;
       end loop;
    doesn't work since declarations are always done even if skipped because
    the symbols need to be in the symbol table when walking through the
    syntax even when the statements aren't being executed.  This is a rare
    case, but it also raises the issue of scope with pullBlock--technically,
    j is a global but pullBlock treats all internal declarations as local.


MAJOR REDESIGNS

  - architecture
    - pragmas for business architecture.  e.g. pragma licence (gpl),
      pragma license_limit_instances( 15 ), pragam license_limit_users( 12 )
  - redesigning the symbol table to handle non-string values
    - allows byte_io package based on sequential_io
    - implement use clause
    - multi-dimensional arrays
    - records should allow nested arrays
    - arrays should support nested arrays
    - linked lists or other container types
  - ParseExpression should return a storage record, not a string, so
    arrays can be returned (and future records, objects)

 - performance enhancements
    - lineRead still reads as unbounded_string instead of copying directly
      into script variable, causing double buffering and conversion slowdowns
    - more sophisticated byte code for speed
       - this will require the scanner and parser holding two different tables for
         identifiers (because only the parser knowns what block(s) an identifier
         belongs to).  Otherwise, the existing get_next_token can be used to
         tokenize the script file.
    - change system calls to get tput results - remove system() reliance
    - "kind" field should be a pointer for speed, not an array index
    - no type-checking after syntax-check stage for performance?  But command
      prompt has no syntax check so must be excluded?
    - a pragma inline should be created in order to cache other scripts
    - DoRunTimeStatments should probably fork and use pipes to read results
      instead of using a temp file
      - otherwise, DoRunTimeStatements only read results one char at a time
    - instead of the fast string library, just store the first character in
      the identifier record and (optionally) test on that?  Use a new record
      type to prevent string assignments without updating the first character.
    - can word_t byte code items also contain a trailing "pattern" as well as
      "word"
    - .list and .FieldOf can be combined as .Owner of aggregate sub item, where
      .owner = eof_t indicates a simple variable.  This would simplify the code.
    - review parser/child package structure.  A better way to organize?

  * Platform issues
   - Spar hangs with vt52 40x8 login, throws exception (perhaps division by
     zero because attributes like bold null strings??)  Also has ctrl-q's
     so maybe a flow of control problem
