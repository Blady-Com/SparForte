<h3><a name="#bush"></a><font color="#777700">1.0 What is Bush?</font></h3>

BUSH is a high-reliability command and web scripting language with a shell
and debugger.  It is built on software engineering principles and emphasizes
reliability, code reuse and scalability.  It's based on an ISO standard and is
compatible with GCC. This means that BUSH scripts can be written and debugged
faster than many other scripting languages, and they are designed for
large-scale, enterprise-wide projects.  This proposed business and scientific
enterprise standard, based on BUSH, GCC and other third-party tools, is
called "ABEE".

<p>The BUSH home page is
<a href="http://www.pegasoft.ca/bush.html">http://www.pegasoft.ca/bush.html</a>.</p>

<p>Bush is useful for any enterprise wishing to lower development time and
costs of scripted applications, increase portability and interoperability
of applications, provide better security, scalability and reduce complexity of
IT infrastructure.</p>

<p>There is a non-technical "Executive Summary" in section 1.1.</p>

<h3><a name="#licensing"></a><font color="#777700">1.0.1 Licensing</font></h3>

BUSH is released under the GNAT-Modified GNU Public Licence.  This is,
essentially, GPL version 2 with an extension ensuring that templates
(generic packages) are also explicitly covered by the GPL.  See the
source file header comments for more information.

<h3><a name=""></a><font color="#777700">1.0.2 Support</font></h3>

The BUSH documentation, the BUSH forum on the PegaSoft Linux Cafe
discussion board, and the BUSH mailing list are all available at
<a href="http://www.pegasoft.ca">http://www.pegasoft.ca</a>.

<h3><a name=""></a><font color="#777700">1.0.3 How to Contribute</font></h3>

BUSH is an Open Source project.  It was developed by volunteers
mostly in their spare time.  Please support BUSH through actively
contributing to BUSH, whether helping users with using their first
Open Source program, translating the BUSH documentation to
languages other than US-English or contributing source code as a
programmer.

<p>The latest stable BUSH source code is made available on the
PegaSoft web site on the BUSH download page.  There is also
a Subversion (SVN) repository which makes available the latest
unstable development version but this is only made available to
core BUSH developers.  A copy of the development version can be
made on request.</p>

<p>We welcome all contributions but please understand that we
may reject a contribution if it conflicts with the design or
goals of BUSH.  Please contact us before beginning any large
contributions to BUSH.</p>

<h3><a name=""></a><font color="#777700">1.0.4 Reporting Bugs</font></h3>

When you find a bug in BUSH, we want to hear about it.  Whether a problem
with the documentation or the software, your bug report plays an important
role in making BUSH more reliable because even the utmost care cannot
guarantee that every part of BUSH will work on every platform under every
circumstance.

<p>BUSH is maintained by volunteers: there is no guarantee that we will
be able to fix your bug right away.  But we still want to hear about it.</p>

<p>If you find a bug, please follow this procedure:</p>

<ul>
<li>Read the manual to make sure that it is actually a bug.  If the documentation
is not clear on the issue, please report that, too.</li>
<li>Check the change log in the PegaSoft Linux Cafe forum to see if a fix has been made or a workaround exists</li>
<li>Create a test project that is as small as possible but still reproduces the bug</li>
<li>Send the test project and a description of the problem to us through the
links on the PegaSoft people page</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="summary"></a><font color="#777700">1.1 Executive Summary</font></h3>

<p>There are many shells, interpreters, languages and web template systems.&nbsp;
Virtually
without exception, they are incompatible with one
another.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
What's the point of learning a tool that, no matter how sophisticated
it
is, leaves your source code stuck with that particular tool.&nbsp; You
want to do scripting, so you use Python or Scheme.&nbsp; You want to do
reporting, so you use Perl or AWK.&nbsp; You want to write a command script, so you
use
Bash or Zsh.&nbsp; You want to write an applet, so you use Java.&nbsp; To be a
programmer these days, you need to be fluent in a dozen different
languages.&nbsp;
You would be making more money if you got a job at the United Nations.
</p>
<p>The Business Shell is different.&nbsp; It is part of a language
environment called ABEE, one of the most powerful and flexible
environments available for Linux today.  ABEE is built around a single language
standard available on almost all Linux platforms, GCC Ada.  Any project you write in Bush is immediately portable to
any machine that GCC runs on.&nbsp;
In other words, virtually everything.&nbsp; And it means that Bush
scripts
can be compiled using GCC and everyone knows that GCC is superior to
most
commercial compilers.

<p>You don't have to rewrite your scripts to use them in applications.
Use the same variable types, the same structures, the same built-in
packages.  Cut-and-paste your code.</p>
<p>If that's not enough, using the JGNAT open
source compiler, you can even compile your Bush scripts into actual
Java
bytecode.&nbsp; There is another tool, A#, that will compile scripts
into
.NET byte code&nbsp; Things don't get much more platform-independent
than
that.
</p>
<p>What about PHP? BUSH has a HTML template engine that runs embedded
scripts in a secure environment. No need to worry about users messing
with
your code...unless you want them to.

<p>It's the same BUSH source code that you use for your scripts.  No need
to learn a special template language with a new set of rules.</p>
<p>But Bush does more than just create scripts, executable programs and
Java applets.&nbsp; It's a powerful computer language on its own able
to
do complex math, manipulate files, generate reports and able to do
network
programming.&nbsp; And there are many built-in packages that will let you
do everything from compute trig functions to connecting to a web server.
</p>
<p>But best of all, Bush is easy.&nbsp; Perl claims to be easy.&nbsp;
Easily
like riding a bicycle backwards in the middle of a thunderstorm.&nbsp;
Bush is easy to read, easy to understand.&nbsp; You know exactly what a
script does without having to have a reference book beside you at all
times
</p>
<p>Bush doesn't run your programs outright.&nbsp; First it examines
them,
compresses them, and converts them into intermediate code.&nbsp;
(That's
"byte code", to you Java developers.) Bush optimizes the program for
the
best possible performance. It also takes the time to verify your
program
will run before attempting to execute the first line.
</p>
<p>And if you make to typing mistake, Bush will let you know before
running
your program.&nbsp; There's no need to worry that your typo will be a
valid
command like it would be in most other languages.&nbsp; Bush works for
you, not against you.
</p>
<p>One tool for all solutions.
</p>
<p>And, yes, Bush is also makes a pretty good shell.
</p>
So you basically have two choices. Keep working for the U.N.,
or
give
Bush a try and make your life a little easier. <br>

&nbsp;
<h3><a name="install"></a><font color="#666600">1.2 Installation<br>
</font></h3>

BUSH requires the GCC Ada (GNAT) run-time library and the standard C library.
To compile BUSH from sources, you will also need BASH, GNU make and GCC Ada.
BUSH was developed on Linux but has been ported to some other platforms.

<p>BUSH has additional requirements depending on what features are
enabled.</p>

<p>For further information, check the INSTALL file included with the BUSH
sources.</p>

The source files and some pre-built versions can be downloaded from the BUSH
home page at

<h3><a name="tech"></a><font color="#777700">1.3 Technical Introduction
</font></h3>
Scripting languages are increasingly popular in commercial work, particularily
in web design.  Some of the problems encountered with today's scripting
languages include area of:
<ul>
<li><b>Code Reuse</b> - sharing source code between the client or server,
templates or applications, or other software developers requires fundamental
change in syntax or semantics, preventing code reuse.</li>
<li><b>Training</b> - software developers must be trained in a variety of
languages each with its own non-standard syntax and unique terminology.
This leads to confusion and prevents peer review.</li>
<li><b>Modal Thinking</b> - software developers are proned, when
using similar languages, to use the syntax of one language when progrmming in a
different language.  This results in statements that are semantically correct
but syntactically wrong for a particular tool.</li>
<li><b>Code Aging</b> - related to scalability, script tend to evolve over time
outstripping the capabilities of the original languages.  These legacy
scripts need to be ported to a different environment which often requires
a complete rewrite into a different language.</li>
<li><b>Design Standardization</b> - what I refer to as the "Kitchen
Sink Syndrome".  Many scripting languages have begin as a project to solve a
particular issue.  For example, Python was created to be easy to use and Perl
was an amalgamation of several UNIX tools.  As the languages age,
new features are added that corrupt the original design goals.  Python is no longer easy
to use.  Perl's syntax conflicts with the original UNIX tools that inspired it.
This is results in similar but incompatible tools with unclear goals.</li>
<li><b>Reliability</b> - many scripting tools have poor error checking and
error-prone syntaxes which require longer testing times and greater chances
of latent run-time errors. Testing applications in these languages require
testing not only high-level functionality but also additional tests for
low-level language issues.</li>
</ul>
<p>Many of these problems can be reduced by using a common development
language for web pages, scripting and application building.  Many languages,
including Java and Perl, offer this kind of capability.</p>
<p>However, comparisons of software development languages, such as
Rational Software's 2005 study by Zeigler
(<a href="http://www.adaic.com/whyada/ada-vs-c/cada_art.html">study</a>)
demonstrate that languages designed for correctness, code reuse and
easy maintenance (so called "software engineering" languages) greatly reduce
costs for businesses.</p>
<p>(Supporters of languages like Perl argue that less typing is the key to
reducing costs.  However, as the size and complexity of projects grow, the
time to type is less significant that the cost of design and bug fixing).</p>
<p>PegaSoft's Business Shell is a scripting language, template engine and
command prompt that is designed to solve these issues and allow faster
development of large-scale web applications compared to other popular tools.</p>
<br>
<h3><a name="abee"></a><font color="#777700">1.4 Ada-BUSH Enterprise
Endeavor (ABEE)<br>
</font></h3>
<p>As long as the command prompt, compiled applications, web templates and
scripts remain in fundamental dischord, these issues will be difficult to
solve.  These development tools cannot agree even on basic issues as
to what constitutes a boolean, the working of a for loop, or the syntax for
an associative array.  There needs to be some structural design agreement
between the development tools in order to create an enterprise-wide, open
source software environment standard.</p>

<p>The standard proposed by PegaSoft is called the <b>Ada-BUSH Enterprise
Endeavor (ABEE)</b>.  BUSH is part of a set of tools built around the ISO
Ada standard to create a standardized framework for create applications.
The other tools include:

</p><ul>
<li><b>GCC/GNAT</b> - to create compiled applications</li>
<li><b>JGNAT</b> - to create JVM byte code</li>
<li><b>A#</b> - to create .Net applets</li>
<li><b>BUSH</b> - command prompt, template engine and scripts</li>
</ul>

<p>Together, these tools compose a standardized framework for developing web
templates, server applications, client side JVM and .Net applets, scripts
and enterprise-wide computing.  In all cases, the basic data types,
control structures and libraries available to the developer have the same
names, the same syntax and the same semantics.  A boolean at the command
prompt is like a boolean in a script is like a boolean in an HTML template
and so forth.  There is agreement at a fundamental structural level between
the development tools.  This agreement promotes code reuse, simplifies
training and peer review, reduces modal thinking errors, makes code age-able
and scalable.</p>

<p>ABEE also serves as an open source alternative to proprietary offerings
like ASP .Net and Sun's J2EE.</p>

<p>In order to achieve standardization, ABEE uses the Ada 95 language.
Ada 95 is the only open source language that provides all of the following
functionality:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Standardized</b> - Ada is an ISO standard which gives the language
long life and compatibility between different vendors.
</li><li><b>Enterprise Features</b> - Ada is a language designed to handle large,
complex applications.  It has extensive features for structuring and testing
multi-developer projects.</li>
<li><b>Strong Error Checking</b> - Ada puts a strong emphasis on catching as
many errors as possible at compile-time, reducing run-time errors and improving
reliability</li>
<li><b>Widely Available</b> - GCC has native Ada support and is included with
most versions of BSD's and Linux.</li>
<li><b>Easily Read and Understood</b> - The syntax of the language avoids
cryptic symbols and promotes code review.</li>
<li><b>Good Performance</b> - GCC Ada binary executables runs at comparable
speeds to GCC C.</li>
<li><b>Open Source</b> - The source code to GCC and BUSH is freely available.</li>
<li><b>Industry Recognized</b> - GNAT Pro, the commercially supported version
of GCC Ada, was a runner up for the <u>Datamation's Enterprise Linux Product of
the Year Award for 2005</u>.<p></p>
</li></ul>

<p>The following chart shows how ABEE can be divided into a multi-tier web
development framework:</p>
<p>&nbsp;
</p>
<center>
<p><img src="bush2ee.gif" alt="[Ada-Bush Enterprise Model]" height="350" width="425"></p>
</center>
<p><i><b>Figure</b>: ABEE Multitier Enterprise Application Model
</i></p>
<p><b><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Client-Side
Presentation</span></span></b><br>
</p>
<p>On a user's desktop, native Ada 95 applications can be
created with the Win32 version of Ada Core Techologies'
GNAT (another name for GCC Ada) or one of the commercial desktop Ada
compilers.&nbsp; Alternatively JVM applications can be created with Ada
Core Technologies' <b>JGNAT</b> Java byte code compiler.&nbsp;
Or create .Net applications using <b>A#</b>, the Ada .Net
compiler.&nbsp; You
can also create JVM or .Net applets to run in a client's web
browser.&nbsp; In all these cases, using Ada means that developers need
to know only one core language.</p>
<p><b><span style="font-weight: bold;">Server-Side Presentation<br>
</span></b></p>
<p>The web server can use BUSH web
templates to create web pages with embedded AdaScript code.&nbsp; Like
JSP, ASP, PHP and similar products, BUSH can connect to databases and
generate new web content dynamically.&nbsp; BUSH templates can
communicate to the other layers by opening TCP/IP sockets (for remote
machines) or by files (on local machines).&nbsp; Using AdaScript for
your templates means that developments use the same core language as
used in the other layers.<br>
</p>
<p><b><span style="font-weight: bold;">Server-Side Business Logic<br>
</span></b></p>
<p>To manage and cache information, compiled applications and server
software can be built using GCC Ada.&nbsp; The server software gain the
speed advantage of binary code for the host machine while still being
able to communicate with the other tiers through files, TCP/IP
sockets.&nbsp; Cluster computer can be done using GCC Ada's GLADE
environment: GLADE partitions a single application over multiple
computers without worrying about the underlying operating system.&nbsp;
You can also share objects using Ada's CORBA implementation.&nbsp;
Process control and information flow can be coordinated by BUSH scripts.</p>
<p><b><span style="font-weight: bold;">Enterprise Information Systems<br>
</span></b></p>
<p>BUSH has integrated support for SQL so there usually no reason to
reply
on a database client program. The stored procedure language for most
databases is very similar to AdaScript and is intuitive to learn and
use
if developers are already familiar with ABEE. The database package with
BUSH
is also available with GCC Ada applications.</p>
<p></p>
<p>
At each layer, developers will need to know only one core language,
with the same basic constructions and types.&nbsp; For example, a "for
loop" is written the same way in any tier, whether for a .Net
application or a BUSH web template.&nbsp; This reduces training costs
and makes source code portable between the tiers over solutions that
require different languages at each tier.&nbsp; In addition, the same
core packages are available (string handling, math, lock file handling,
I/O, and others).</p>
<p><b><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></span></span></b>
</p>
<p>In comparison, consider Sun's <b>Java 2 Enterprise Edition</b>
(J2EE) environment.&nbsp;
Java "components" (small
applications)
can be distributed across an information system using secure
connections
to negotiate with one another. Ignoring Sun's marketing buzzwords, you
can see that the open source ABEE approach is as good as or superior to
J2EE:
</p>
<ul>
  <li> <b>multitiered applications</b> - Ada applications and BUSH
scripts
can
be distributed across multiple machines and accessed using secure
connections
using proven technologies.&nbsp; Ada applications can be multithreaded
and can multiplex requests from multiple sources the same way as Java
applications.&nbsp;
Scripts can handle multiple requests through multiple user
sessions--BUSH
features such as the Lock_Files package can ensure coordinated access
to
files.</li>
  <li> <b>J2EE applications</b> - Java can partition large
applications
across
multiple machines transparently.&nbsp; So can GCC Ada using the GLADE
distributed
application tool.</li>
  <li> <b>Java servlets</b> - GCC Ada and BUSH both have support for
creating
servlets (web server applications).</li>
  <li> <b>EJB (Enterprise Java Beans)</b> - the tools to implement
secure
communication
between processes and machines have long been available under Linux,
adhering
to industry standards such as CORBA and not requiring proprietary
systems
like the ones Java uses.</li>
</ul>
J2EE is not your only solution for writing multitiered enterprise
applications.&nbsp;
The ABEE strategy offers the same advantages as solutions offered by
Sun.
Reusable components, client interaction using HTML/XML/HTTP,
scalability
and high availability over a network are all possible with an ABEE
strategy. Ada-Bush allows applications to be written once and run
everywhere,
supports CORBA technology to interface with existing enterprise
resources,
and creates a single standard that can be use effectively throughout an
enterprise. Plus you get to use a truly scalable language system that
cuts
down training expenses and allows applications to be "scaled up" with
minimum
effort.

<p>GCC Ada is available in an award-winning, commercial, supported edition

</p></p>
<h3><a name="prob1"></a><font color="#777700">1.5 How Bush Improves Code Reuse
</font></h3>
<p>To further illustrate BUSH's advantages over other popular tools, let us
examine some of the issues raised in section 1.2 in detail.</p>

<p>The fundamental differents in syntax or semantics between different web
development tools has led to difficulties in sharing source code between
applications or developers.  Consider the issue of null or undefined variables
which have no associated value, string concatenation and array referencing.</p>

<p>The conventional C, Perl, PHP or BASH shell solution have no agreement on
these basic features:</p>

<table summary="Language Features" border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="1">

    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Moving source code between these tools is inherently difficult even though
they are often employed simultaenously for a web-based application.</p>

<p>The ABEE solution using BUSH provides fundamental consistency across these
features:</p>

<h3><a name="prob2"></a><font color="#777700">1.6 How Bush Eases Training
</font></h3>

<p>Many of the different tools employ their own unique syntax for features
that are essentially the same.  In the preceeding section it was demonstrated
how features, even very basic ones, are used in incompatible ways.  However
these tools often use their own unique terminology.</p>

<p>Consider how popular scripting languages declare a subprogram:</p>

<table summary="Language Terminology" border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="1">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>&nbsp;<b>Terminology</b>&nbsp;</td>
      <td>&nbsp;<b>GCC C Application</b>&nbsp;</td>
      <td>&nbsp;<b>Perl Script</b>&nbsp;</td>
      <td>&nbsp;<b>PHP Template</b>&nbsp;</td>
      <td>&nbsp;<b>Shell Prompt</b>&nbsp;</td>
      <td>&nbsp;<b>Python Script</b>&nbsp;</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>&nbsp;<i>Subprogram Declaration</i>&nbsp;</td>
      <td bgcolor="lightgrey">function (<u>type</u> <u>name</u> ...)</td>
      <td bgcolor="lightgrey">subroutine (sub)</td>
      <td bgcolor="lightgrey">function</td>
      <td bgcolor="lightgrey">function (<u>name</u>() ...)</td>
      <td bgcolor="lightgrey">function (def)</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>People using these languages cannot even agree on what to call a routine
with a name because there's no consistent terminology.  When one developer
refers to a def and another refers to a sub, how can they understand one
another?</p>

<p>BUSH and ABEE tools have consistent terminology:</p>

<table summary="Language Terminology" border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="1">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>&nbsp;<b>Terminology</b>&nbsp;</td>
      <td>&nbsp;<b>GCC Ada Application</b>&nbsp;</td>

<p>It is easy to see how programmers can be divided into camps by this
modern day "Tower of Babel", all taking about the same issues but unable
to express the issues in common terminology.</p>

<h3><a name="prob3"></a><font color="#777700">1.7 How Bush Reduces Modal
Thinking</font></h3>

<p>When programmers try to use similar but incompatible languages on a single
project, they run the risk of using the wrong syntax for the current
language they are using.  What they type is correct...if they were using
something else.</p>

<p>Here's an example using string and numerical equality.  Scripting languages
that are "typeless" require different operator to compare strings and numbers:</p>

<table summary="Language Modes" border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="1">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>&nbsp;<b>Feature</b>&nbsp;</td>
      <td>&nbsp;<b>GCC C Application</b>&nbsp;</td>
      <td>&nbsp;<b>Perl Script</b>&nbsp;</td>
      <td>&nbsp;<b>PHP Template</b>&nbsp;</td>
      <td>&nbsp;<b>Shell Prompt</b>&nbsp;</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>&nbsp;<i>String Equality</i>&nbsp;</td>
      <td bgcolor="lightgrey">strcmp/strncmp</td>
      <td bgcolor="lightgrey">eq</td>
      <td bgcolor="lightgrey">==</td>
      <td bgcolor="lightgrey">=</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>&nbsp;<i>Number Equality</i>&nbsp;</td>

      <td bgcolor="lightgrey">==</td>
      <td bgcolor="lightgrey">==</td>
      <td bgcolor="lightgrey">-eq</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Notice the problem of Perl and Shell: they both use "eq" <u>but for
opposite uses</u>.  A single equal sign is sometimes used for assignment or
comparision.  A double equal sign can be used for either string or numeric
comparision, depending on the language.</p>

<p>Compare this to ABEE approach with BUSH:</p>

<table summary="Language Modes" border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="1">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>&nbsp;<b>Feature</b>&nbsp;</td>
      <td>&nbsp;<b>GCC Ada Application</b></td>

<p>There is a consistent way to compare strings or numbers across the scripts,
applications, templates and command prompt.  There is no danger of accidently
using the wrong operator when you are looking at the wrong type of source
code.</p>

<h3><a name="prob4"></a><font color="#777700">1.8 How Bush Manages Code
Aging--The Progressive Development Model</font></h3>

BUSH recognizes a fundamental problem in business programming.
Programmers
with limited time and resources are often required to write up quick
scripts
to solve pressing business problems. Once the script is written, they
have
no time to return to the script to write a "proper" solution. Scripts,
designed for rapid and simple solutions, continue to grow and mutate,
becoming
rapidly unreadable and easily broken, leaving a complete rewrite in a
different
language as the only way to upgrade the software.
<p>To combat this problem, BUSH scripts can be developed using a
progressive
development model.
</p>
<p>In its native mode, BUSH provides a quick and easy environment to
write
short Linux programs. Like BASH, Perl, PHP or Python, variables can be declared anywhere and
can be typeless. Although its structure is relaxed compared to a
compiled
programming language, BUSH's syntax is both easy to read and
provides much more security against typing errors.  Common
errors in these other scripting languages such as missing a quotation or spelling mistakes on
variable
names are quickly caught.
</p>
<p>As an BUSH script grows over time, becoming longer and carring more
responsibility, the structure of the script can be improved by using
"pragma
ada_95". This BUSH directive disables many of the "lazy" features
such as typeless variables and requires closer conformation to GCC Ada.
A programmer can "tighten" his code as part of his regular duties,
add type checking, and ensure that the script's structure is sound and
the source is readable without resorting to a complete rewrite.  Some
important scripting features, like running commands in the background
with "&amp;", are still allowed.
</p>
<p>Finally, if the BUSH script continues to grow and is no longer
suitable
as a script, the script can be compiled with minimum changes as an Ada
program. With other shells and scripting languages, a developer would
have
no choice but to rewrite the script "from scratch".
</p>
<p>Bush also has built-in obsolecense control using "pragma deprecated"
(or "pragma depreciated").  This marks obsolete scripts or templates being
phased out of a project, allowing them to be removed in a controlled manner
without disrupting the project.</p>

<h3><a name="prob5"></a><font color="#777700">1.9 How Bush Provides Design
Standardization</font></h3>

<p>BUSH is designed to be compliant with the ISO standard.  Each version
of BUSH moves closer to this goal.  As BUSH adds new features, they are
implemented based on a recognized internation standard, not based on the
language designer's whims.</p>

<table summary="Language Irregularities" border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="1">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>&nbsp;<b>Feature</b>&nbsp;</td>
      <td>&nbsp;<b>GCC C Application</b>&nbsp;</td>

      <td bgcolor="lightgrey">Shell grep or $ exprssions</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>This kind of inconstent behaviour is a result of the "kitchen sink
syndrome": throwing in features from different sources without thought to
the overall impact on the language.  Perl and Shell use grep, but they
are not the same grep.  C and PHP uses strstr but the strings behave
somewhat differently.</p>

<p>BUSH and ABEE languages share one function with a common name:</p>

<p>(In BUSH there is only one string type so the type name is omitted.)</p>

<p>BUSH avoids the feature creep that affects even common library functions
but following a recognized standard.</p>

<h3><a name="prob6"></a><font color="#777700">1.10 How Bush Improves Reliability
</font></h3>

<p>Most scripting languages have forsaken reliability for convenience.
Popular justifications for this are:
</p><ul>
<li>"Smaller" source code means "a reduced target for errors".</li>
<li>Languages should do what you mean not what you say.</li>
<li>You have to write test suites (and, perhaps, code review) anyway, so why
have a language that tries to help you?</li>
</ul>

<p>However, studies have not backed up these claims.  There have been numerous
studies, particularly between C and Ada, that demonstrate that Ada developers
complete projects faster and have fewer errors.  Ada is a language designed
for reliability.  For example, an in-depth 1995 study by Stephen F. Zeigler
(http://www.adaic.com/docs/reports/cada/cada_art.html) showed that development
in Ada costs about half that of C++. It also suggests that Ada produces
"almost 90% fewer bugs for the final customer".</p>

<p>BUSH complies to the Ada languages for high reliability and implements
a number of security features that restrict what scripts and templates can
and cannot do.  BUSH implements strong typing, explicit type conversion and
required variable declarations because these are basic features in the war on
bugs.  Saving a few seconds on typing is not worth a few hours of debugging.</p>

<p>For example, consider the issue called "type juggling".  If there are two
alternatives for automatic type conversion, the programmer must try to guess
which conversion the language will use.  This can have unusual side-effects
such as in PHP where "hello" == 0 is false but in Perl it is true.  This
kind of problem cannot occur in BUSH.</p>

<p>For another example, not having to declare variables or their types saves
a few keystrokes.  However, the savings is an illusion as you have to use
different operators (effectively declaring the types) in expressions.  Without
declared variables and types, the language is left without redundant
information to identify many common mistakes.</p>

<p>When you run a short BUSH script and BUSH does not complain, there is a
good chance the script will work properly the first time "out of the box".
With other tools, you are rolling dice.</p>

<h3><a name="compare"></a><font color="#777700">1.11 Comparing BUSH</font></h3>
<p>There are many open source scripting languages and shells
available.&nbsp;
They are often created to solve particular kinds of problems.&nbsp; The
following sections summarize the major differences between BUSH and
these
other common tools.
<br>
<br>
&nbsp;
</p>
<h3><a name="bash"></a><font color="#777700">BUSH vs. BASH</font></h3>
BASH (the "Bourne Again SHell") is an extended version of the
traditional
UNIX Bourne shell (sh).&nbsp;&nbsp; BASH supports most of the Bourne
shell's
original syntax, but also has features of the C and Korn shells such as
integer and array variables.&nbsp; The Bourne shell syntax is hard to
debug
and is not compatible with other computer languages.&nbsp; BASH can act
as an interactive shell or can run scripts.
<p>BUSH is a shell that&nbsp; has the fundamental syntax of the Bourne
shell.&nbsp; However, BUSH uses a different language for advanced
features
making BUSH easier to read and debug.&nbsp; BUSH scripts can be
compiled
into Java or .NET byte code or into an executable program.&nbsp; BUSH's
reliability, scalability and speed make it ideally suited for
professional
scripting projects.&nbsp; BUSH can act as an interactive shell and can
run scripts.
</p>
<h3><a name="python"></a><font color="#777700">BUSH vs. Python</font></h3>
Python (named after "Monty Python") is an interpreted language designed
for small projects needing rapid development. It is not a shell.
Because of it's weak encapsulation features and lack of strong
typing,Python
scripts are limited in scalability and extensibility. The shortcuts
provided by Python cause reliability problems in large, complex
projects.
Because of its proprietary design, projects developed in Python cannot
easily
be upgraded to a compiled language.
<p>BUSH is a shell and language designed for high reliability business
and scientific applications. BUSH scripts are slower to develop than
Python
programs but are easier to maintain over the lifetime of a project. The
shortcuts BUSH provides are carefully chosen so as not to undercut
reliability.
BUSH scripts can be easily upgraded to a compiled language.
</p>
<h3><a name="perl"></a><font color="#777700">BUSH vs. Perl</font></h3>
Perl ("Practical Extraction and Report Language") is, as its name
suggests,
a scripting language for data analysis and designing reports. PERL is
good
for writing short scripts to process text information such as system
logs.
<p>Perl is well known for being hard to learn and read. It combines the
features of completely unrelated tools (including shell scripts, the
sed
command, and the awk command). In fact, this was the reason Larry Wall
developed Perl in the first place. Perl scripts must be extensively
commented
to be readable. BUSH, on the other hand, is based on an international
standard and has features that are designed to fit together smoothly.
BUSH
scripts are very readable, even with limited comments.
</p>
<p>Perl developers also endorse Perl's shortcuts as making scripts more
reliable (by making them a smaller) and as aid for programmers. BUSH
also
contains shortcuts, but it makes no claim that smaller scripts are
easier to
maintain. While Perl shortcuts can actually hurt development, BUSH's
shortcuts
are carefully chosen so that a programmer can't "shoot himself in the
foot".
Some kinds of shortcuts are dangerous. Perl will convert a number to a
string
automatically, whether or not the programmer made a mistake. If BUSH
sees a
number where a string was expected, it reports it as a serious
contradiction.
</p>
<p>Perl is not a shell and is not designed to run programs or to handle
process control. However, it contains many features beyond report
generation,
including interprocess communication and database access. Because of
its
pattern matching features, cryptic syntax and shell-like quoting rules,
Perl
makes large projects error-prone and difficult to maintain.
</p>
<p>Perl is often described as portable. With GNU tools and the Linux
operating
system, portable languages like PERL are no longer necessary. Even when
PERL
is chosen for portability, it is not based on any standard: features
can
change and break between even minor releases of PERL making PERL
scripts
difficult to port and upgrade. BUSH is heavily tested and based on an
international standard making it more portable than PERL.
</p>
<p>BUSH is a Linux shell and shell language designed for high
reliability
business and scientific applications. Although it's not a report
generation
language, it can generate reports using formatted output and pattern
matching
like PERL does.
</p>
<p>BUSH scripts are not as "quick-and-dirty" as PERL but
but BUSH scripts are easier to maintain over the lifetime of a project.
Because of its emphasis on a typo-resistant syntax, BUSH is easier to
maintain, especially when used large projects. BUSH scripts can also be
compiled into executable programs, Java applets or .Net programs.
</p>
<h3><a name="plsql"></a><font color="#666600">BUSH vs. PL/SQL</font></h3>
PL/SQL is the Oracle stored procedure language.&nbsp; Both BUSH and
PL/SQL
are based on Ada making BUSH very easy to learn for PL/SQL users.&nbsp;
Many PL/SQL commands and statements will work in BUSH.&nbsp; BUSH
supports
the PostgreSQL database and you can execute queries and examine
results.
<h3><a name="psql"></a><font color="#666600">BUSH vs. PostgreSQL psql</font></h3>
psql is the text-based database client for PostgreSQL. You can display
information about databases, run queries and get formatted responses.
It
is not a shell and cannot run shell commands.
<p>BUSH is a shell and scripting language. In addition, it can display
information about PostgreSQL databases, run queries and display the
results
as psql-style responses all at the BUSH command prompt. The user
doesn't
have to switch between a shell and psql--BUSH handles most database
needs
by itself.
</p>
<h3><a name="ada95"></a><font color="#777700">BUSH vs. Ada 95</font></h3>
Ada 95 (named after the world's first programmer) is a multithreaded,
exception
handling, object-oriented programming language used for large,
high-integrity
projects. It is known for abundant features, high performance, strong
checking
and readability.
<p>The BUSH shell is not an Ada interpreter. BUSH uses AdaScript, a
subset
of the Ada 95 language with additional features specifically for
interactive
shell sessions. Because of its Ada 95 background, BUSH scripts are easy
to create, maintain, debug and can be compiled into fast, executable
programs
using an Ada 95 compiler.
</p>
<p>If you are looking for full Ada compilers or interpreters, they are
available on the Internet.
</p>
<h3><a name="java"></a><font color="#777700">BUSH vs. Java</font></h3>
Java is an interpreted programming language with threads, exception
handling
and object-oriented features. It can be compiled into "byte code" and
applets
can be created for web pages.&nbsp; Java is known for it's awkward
syntax,
poor performance and debugging problems because of its C
heritage.&nbsp;
Java is not a shell.
<p>BUSH scripts can also be compiled into Java or .NET byte code (using
the JGNAT compiler) and run the same way as Java applets/applications,
including web page applets.&nbsp; BUSH scripts are easy to create,
maintain,
debug and can be compiled into fast, executable programs using GCC.
</p>
<h3><a name="php"></a><font color="#666600">BUSH vs. PHP</font></h3>
PHP is an HTML preprocessor and scripting language. In many ways, PHP
resembles Perl but it is not Perl-compatible. PHP is often difficult to
debug. It is not a shell and it does not have a native template engine.
<p>BUSH is a shell and language designed for high reliability business
and scientific applications. BUSH scripts are more secure and robust
than PHP and they are easier to debug and maintain over the lifetime of
a project. BUSH has a native template engine. BUSH scripts can be
easily
upgraded to fast, compiled applications (using GCC) or applets (with
JGNAT).
</p>
<h3><a name="ruby"></a><font color="#666600">BUSH vs. Ruby</font></h3>
Ruby is a scripting language with threads, exception handling and
objects.&nbsp;
Ruby is completely object oriented.&nbsp; Ruby has a very compressed
syntax
that uses the "Principle of Least Surprise"--that is, Ruby attempts to
"second guess" the programmer.&nbsp; In some cases, removing a single
space,
or capitalizing a single letter, can cause a Ruby script to radically
change
its behavior.&nbsp; Ruby is not a shell.
<p>BUSH is a shell and language designed for high reliability business
and scientific applications. BUSH scripts are slower to develop than
Ruby
programs but are easier to maintain over the lifetime of a project.
Changing
capitalization and white space does not change the how a script is run.
BUSH features do not fall victim to the "feature bloat" syndrome that
weakens
the reliability of a language. BUSH scripts can be easily upgraded to a
compiled application or applet.
</p>
<h3><a name="ruby"></a><font color="#666600">BUSH vs. Lua</font></h3>
Lua's web site describes it as a "powerful, fast and light-weight".
These are hype terms and contradictory: something cannot be
powerful and light at the same time, the way gold is not free and
a Ford Focus is not a luxury car.  Lua is an open-source language
designed for game scripting.  It is popular with Portugese developers.
<p>Although Lua scripts look similar to the Business Shell,
Lua is not designed on software engineering principles.  It cannot
be effectively used in enterprise programming.

</font></h3>
<h4><a name="critics1"></a><font color="#666600">1.13.1 Strong-Typing Makes Scripting Impossible</li>
</font></h4>
<p>In <a href="http://jan.newmarch.name/xscript/shellprogramming2.html">"Teaching Shell Programming in a GUI Environment"</a>, a paper for the School of Network Computing ,
J D Newmarch states that "there was once an Ada command language shell
[cited as BUSH] which was quite unusable due to its requirements for strongly-typed
 variable declarations."</p>
<p>In reponse, Mr. Newmarch fails to explain why strongly-typed variables
declarations make shells "unusable" and he fails to mention that Bush
has universal typed variables that act more like a more traditional shell.
He fails to mention this in his paper.</p>
<p>Universal type variables permit data of different types to be freely
mixed at the shell prompt.  Bush also supports most Bourne shell conventions,
such as dollar sign variable expansion in commands:</p>
<pre>
=&gt; temp : universal_typeless
=&gt; temp := 5
=&gt; ? temp * 2
 10
=&gt; temp := "/usr/local/bin"
=&gt; ls $temp
amaya     cfsndserv        chdman     gcfclient2  ices     romcmp  xmame.x11
cfclient  cfsndserv_alsa9  gcfclient  gxmame      jedutil  tia     xml2info
</pre>
<p>Even with strong typing, shell scripts predominantly work with strings.
In most cases, simply declaring a string variables is as good as a universal
type variable.</p>
<pre>
=&gt; unset temp
=&gt; temp : string := `ls /usr/local/bin;`
=&gt; ? temp
amaya
cfclient
cfsndserv
cfsndserv_alsa9
chdman
gcfclient
gcfclient2
gxmame
ices
jedutil
romcmp
tia
xmame.x11
xml2info
</pre>
<p>BUSH's shell features are flexiable and usable and the addition of
strong-typing is a valuable, optional tool for code correctness and
maintenance.  It is also beneficial for teaching shell programming
and the principles of good programming.</p>

<p>As Brooks says in "The Mythical Man-Month", "In a single task, the assumption
is that all will go well has a probabilistic effect on the schedule.  It
might indeed go as planned for there is a probability distribution for the
delay that will be encountered, and "no delay" has a finite probability.
A large programming effort, however, consists of many tasks, some chained
end-to-end.  The probability that each will go well becomes vanishingly
small."</p>
<p>Rather than start with a light-weight language--one short, cryptic and
easy to make errors in but fast to type and get simple applications working
and then tack on the necessary features for large-scale development, Bush
takes the opposite approach.  Start with a programming language built for
large-scale development, then reduce the complexity where required (while
maintaining as much compatibility with the existing standard as possible)
to create a language that can grow in "heavy-handedness" as such heavy
handedness is required by agrowing, thriving project.</p>
