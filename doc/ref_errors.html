<h2><a name="3.30"></a>Common Error Messages</h2>

<p>Note: Some of these may be obsolete.</p>

<b>@ is not allowed with pragma ada_95</b> - @ (itself) is not an Ada
95
feature. Fill in the actual variable name.

<br>
<b>% is not allowed with pragma ada_95</b> - % (last output) is not
an Ada 95 feature.
<br>
<b>$# not allowed with pragma ada_95</b> - $# is not an Ada 95 feature.
Use the command_line package instead.
<br>
<b>$0 not allowed with pragma ada_95</b> - $0 is not an Ada 95 feature.
Use the command_line package instead.
<br>
<b>$1..$9 not allowed with pragma ada_95</b> - $1 to $9 are not an
Ada 95 feature. Use the command_line package instead.
<br>

<b>absolute paths to commands not allowed in restricted shells</b>
- absolute paths are a security risk because they allow a restricted
shell
or script to run any command (provided they have permission to do so).
<br>
<b>access to this TCP/IP port is prohibited</b> - certain URL port
numbers are reserved for special functions or are non-standard across
different
operating systems. Choose a different port number.
<br>
<b>alias isn't supported</b> - since SparForte has no access types, the
Ada keyword alias isn't supported by SparForte.
<br>
<b>already declared</b> - the name is already defined in the symbol
table as something else
<br>
<b>assertion failed</b> - the condition for the assert pragma evaluated
to false.

<br>
<b>boolean expression expected</b> - SparForte was expected something that
equates to "true" or "false" but found something else instead. For
example,
"if 2+2 then". Check your expression.
<br>
<b>boolean operator expected</b> - SparForte was expecting a AND, OR or
XOR. Usually indicates something is missing in the command.
<br>
<b>Bourne shell-style parameters not allowed with pragma ada_95</b>
- Bourne shell parameters are not a feature of Ada 95. Use Ada-style
parameters
instead.
<br>
<b>Break</b> - a <i>pragma inspection_point</i> was encountered, or
the program was interrupted with control-c (SIGINT).

<br>
<b>cannot create an in file</b> - a file must first have data written
to it before it can be read. You cannot read a newly created file.
<br>
<b>cd is not allowed in a restricted shell</b> - <i>cd</i> is a
security
risk because the user or script can run different commands if they
change
their current directory.
<br>
<b>character literal more than 1 character</b> - single quotes denote
a character literal such as 'a' or '1'. Double quotes denote strings of
more one or more characters.
<br>
<b>command types not allowed with pragma ada_95</b> - command types
are not a feature of Ada 95. Try implementing them as strings.

<br>
<b>command variables must be constant</b> - commands can only be
declared
as a <i>constant</i>.
<br>
<b>create not allowed in a restricted shell</b> - restricted shells
and scripts cannot create new files.
<br>
<b>current directory not assessible / doesn't exist</b> - your current
directory was deleted or had its permissions changed.
<br>
<b>else without if</b> - SparForte is unable to find the <i>if</i> that
belongs to your <i>else</i>. Check the structure of your if's.

<br>
<b>elsif without if</b> - same as above.
<b>end of file</b> - your
program has attempted to read past the end of the file
<br>
<b>end_of_file only applies to in_mode files</b> - the end_of_file
function only applied when reading files. When writing or appending to
files, you are always at the end of file.
<br>
<b>expected parent unit FILE</b> - the name of the parent unit in
the separate statement doesn't match the unit name.
<br>
<b>exception raised</b> - the operation was not permitted. For example,
dividing by zero or doing arithmetic with a variable that has no value.
<br>
<b>file already open</b> - the file_type variable was already opened
by

<i>open</i> or <i>create</i> but it must be closed before it is
reopened.
<br>
<b>file not open</b> - the file_type variable hasn't been opened yet
with
<i>open</i> or <i>create</i>.
<br>
<b>file_type expected</b> - SparForte was expected a file_type variable
in an open, create, etc. command. Check the type and order of your
parameters.

<br>
<b>file_type or socket_type variable expected</b> - same as above.
<br>
<b>functions not implemented</b> - user-defined functions are not yet
implemented
<br>
<b>include file FILE doesn't exist or is not readable</b> - SparForte
is unable to find your separate subprogram.  The filename is
spelled wrong, not in the search path, or cannot be read by SparForte.
<b>invalid based numeric literal</b> - usually specifying a base and
using number characters larger than the base allows
<br>
<b>is not an executable command</b> - the command cannot be found or
you do not have permission to run it.
<br>

<b>limited types cannot be assigned a value</b> - limited types are
assigned values by SparForte. They cannot be assigned values.
<br>
<b>missing statement or command</b> - block statements must contain
statements or commands. Use the <i>null</i> command if there are no
statements
or commands.
<br>
<b>no &amp; - final piped command always runs in the foreground</b>
- the last command in a pipeline cannot have a &amp; (run in
background).
(This is also true in BASH.)

<br>
<b>no &amp; - piped commands are automatically run the the background</b>
- commands being piped don't need a &amp; (run in background) since
they
must always run in the background. The &amp; is implicit.
<br>
<b>no enclosing loop to exit</b> - <i>exit</i> was used while not in
a loop. If you want to quit an interactive session, use <i>logout</i>.

<br>
<b>no such argument</b> - the $1..$9 you are referning to doesn't
exist.
<br>
<b>not declared</b> - the name has not been defined in the symbol
table.
Often indicates a spelling mistake
<br>
<b>number format picture string expected</b> - the <i>put</i> appears
to be a formatted put, but there is no format picture or the picture
isn't
a string.
<br>
<b>number not a valid format picture</b> - the number cannot be
displayed
using the format picture string. For example, the number is too big.

<br>
<b>numeric or enumerated type expected</b> - for loops can only loop
over numeric or enumerated ranges. For example, <i>for s in "a".."z"
loop</i>
is a string range.
<br>
<b>only numeric types can use a format picture</b> - Only numeric
values
can be put with formatting. Strings or other types cannot be used.
<br>
<b>operation (something) not defined for these types</b> - In this
context, the arithmetic operation doesn't make sense. For example,
using
** for two strings.
<br>
<b>operation not defined for string types</b> - for example, attempting
to multiply two strings

<br>
<b>operator expected</b> - SparForte was expected an arithmetic operator
like +. Usually indicates something missing in the command.
<br>
<b>out_file mode not allowed in a restricted shell</b> - files cannot
be overwritten in restricted scripts or shells.
<br>
<b>packages not implemented</b> - user-defined packages are not yet
implemented
<br>
<b>pathname should not be null</b> - empty pathnames ("") are now
allowed.
Omit the pathname if you want SparForte to create a temporary name, or check
your string to find out why the pathname is missing.
<br>

<b>pipelines are not allowed with pragma ada_95</b> - pipelines ("|")
are not a feature of Ada 95. Use pipe files or share the results using
a temporary file.
<br>
<b>possible type of</b> - the name has not been defined in the symbol
table but appears to be similar to the spelling of another, defined
name.
<br>
<b>procedures not implemented</b> - user-defined procedures are not
yet implemented
<br>
<b>protected types not implemented</b> - AdaScript doesn't implement
Ada's protected types because there is no multithreading.
<br>
<b>return cannot return a status code with pragma ada_95. use
command_line
package</b> - Bourne shell's <i>return</i> can return a status code,
but
Ada's <i>return</i> does not permit a status code.

<br>
<b>sockets don't have a mode</b> - socket_type variables are always
in and out simultaneously. Don't specify a mode.
<br>
<b>standard_input (or output or error) cannot be assigned to (output
or input)</b> - standard input can only be read. Standard output and
error
can only be written.
<br>
<b>tasks not implemented</b> - AdaScript doesn't implement Ada's tasks
or task types because there is no multithreading.
<br>
<b>this file is the current (input/output/error) file</b> - you cannot
close standard input, output or error. For example, SparForte will not allow
you to close the keyboard in an interactive session.
<br>

<b>this is not an interactive shell--use return</b> - <i>logout</i>
is not permitted in scripts because you are not "logged in".
<br>
<b>too many identifiers (symbol table overflow)</b> - SparForte has no space
to declare any more identifiers. Your program has too many variables
declared.
Try breaking up the variables with <i>declare</i> blocks.
<br>
<b>too many nested statements (block table overflow)</b> - there are
too many nested block statements. For example, very many <i>if</i>

statements
with no <i>end if</i>.
<br>
<b>type name expected, not a number</b> - for example, expected <i>integer</i>
but found a <i>14</i> instead<b>type name expected, not a string
literal</b>
- for example, expected
<i>integer</i> but found <i>"hello world!"</i>

instead<b>type name expected, not a keyword</b> - for example, expected
<i>integer</i>
but found <i>then</i> instead<b>type name expected, not a symbol</b> -
for example, expected <i>integer</i> but found a semicolon<b>typeset
is
not allowed with pragma ada_95</b> - <i>typeset</i> is not a feature
of
Ada 95. Use a different variable with a new type.

<br>
<b>typeset is only allowed in an interactive session</b> - <i>typeset</i>
is an interactive session convenience. It is not intended for use in
scripts
because it makes scripts difficult to read.
<br>
<b>unable to allocate memory to call command</b> - your system is out
of (virtual) memory.
<br>
<b>unable to open file</b> - the operating system report a problem
while opening the file. For example, you may not have permission to
open
the file or the file has been locked by someone else.
<br>
<b>unable to interpret TCP/IP host</b> - the format of the URL is
wrong.
For example, a missing hostname may cause this error.

<br>
<b>unable to interpret TCP/IP port</b> - the format of the URL is
wrong.
For example, a colon without a port number may cause this error.
<br>
<b>unable to open socket</b> - SparForte was unable to establish a socket
to the URL. For example, your Internet connection may be down or the
host
name is spelled wrong.
<br>
<b>unable to delete file</b> - the operating system reported a problem
while deleting the file. For example, the file may have been deleted by
someone else already.
<br>
<b>unable to read file</b> - the operating system reported a problem
while reading the file. For example, the file may have been deleted by
someone else.
<br>

<b>unable to set input (or output or error)</b> - the operating system
reports that the file cannot be made into the current source of input
or
output.
<br>
<b>unable to write file</b> - the operating system reported a problem
while writing the file. For example, the file may have been locked by
someone
else to prevent writing.
<br>
<b>unexpected arguments after &amp;</b> - when a command is run in
the background using &amp;, the &amp; must be the last symbol.
<br>
<b>universal/typeless types not supported by pragma ada_95</b> -
universal
types are not a feature of Ada 95. Use other types instead.

<br>
<b>unset is not allowed with pragma ada_95</b> - <i>unset</i> is not
an Ada 95 feature.
<br>
<b>unset only allowed in interactive sessions</b> - unset cannot be
used in scripts. It is a interactive session convenience.
<br>
<b>unsetting PATH is not allowed in a restricted shell</b> - changing
PATH is a security risk because it changes what programs can be run
from
the restricted shell or script.
<br>
<b>use not implemented</b> - this Ada command is not yet implemented.

<br>
<b>variable/value expected</b> - SparForte found a keyword but was expecting
a variable or a literal. Usually indicates something missing in the
command.
<br>
<b>variable not allowed as a case</b> - in a case statement, <i>when</i>
cases cannot contain variables.
<br>
<b>warning: This is an interactive shell. Use logout.</b> - Use logout
to stop an interactive session, not <i>return</i>.

<br>
<b>when others expected</b> - case statements must always have a <i>when
others</i> part.
<br>
<b>with not implemented</b> - this Ada command is not yet implemented.<br>
