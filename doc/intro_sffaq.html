	<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<p>This section contains answers to frequently asked questions on SparForte.</p>

<p>See also: Git-Hub Wiki at
<a href="https://github.com/kburtch/SparForte/wiki">https://github.com/kburtch/SparForte/wiki</a>.</p>

<h3>Introductory Questions</h3>

<h4>What does Sparforte Stand For?</h4>

<img class="padded_left" src="pictures/sf2_ryu.png" width="128" height="103" alt="[Ryu]" \>

<p>To "Spar" is to duel.  "Forte" (pronounced FORE-tay) is a music term
for loudness.  If you are going to spar, spar loud.  Together "Sparforte"
expresses "sound design".</p>

<img class="padded_right" src="pictures/roosevelt_bridge.jpg" width="128" height="92" alt="[Roosevelt Bridge]" \>
<p>"Spar" is also a stout naval mast or boom and "Forte" is a proficiency
or skill.  So, alternatively, "Sparforte" can also mean a proficient or
skillful programming framework.</p>

<p>Spar can also mean to argue in a non-aggressive way, as with critics.</p>

<p>"Sparforte" expresses confident strength and quality engineering.  Work
fast.  Work well.</p>

<h4>What is the Difference between Bush (Business Shell) and Sparforte?</h4>

<p>The Business Shell (or Bush) was the original name of the project.</p>

<p>There were frequent complaints that Bush was a poor choice for Internet
searches.  "Bush" results in millions of page hits for a famous family.
"Business Shell" resulted in millions of pages hits for a petroleum
company.</p>

<p>After several dozen names were reviewed, "Sparforte" was chosen as the
new name for the project.</p>

<h4>Can Sparforte run Bush (Business Shell) scripts?</h4>

<p>Yes.  The only exception is that web template tags must be
&lt;?spar instead of &lt;?bush.</p>

<h4>What is AdaScript?  How does it relate to Sparforte?</h4>

<p>AdaScript is the programming language used by Sparforte.  Sparforte
is the original AdaScript interpreter.  Since the language and the
interpreter names are different, other projects can be developed using
AdaScript--even other interpeters.</p>

<h4>What are the biggest differences between Ada and AdaScript?</h4>

<p>AdaScript is intended to be a subset of Ada 95 with extensions
for the Bourne shell and SQL.  However, if you come from an Ada
background, you'll notice some key differences:</p>

<ol>
<li>AdaScript is case sensitive</li>
<li>Numeric and character literals are universal types.</li>
<li>String literals are unbounded_strings not fixed strings / arrays.</li>
<li>Ada attributes are implemented as built-in package functions.</li>
<li>"with" and "use" are not available.  Built-in functions have similar
package names but may not be identical.</li>
</ol>

<h4>What is Sparforte/BUSH 2.0?</h4>

<p>This is an advanced protoptype for upcoming features.  The prototype
is prerelease and unstable: it may not compile or function.  It is
intended for use by SparForte developers.  Periodic snapshots are put
on the SparForte home page.</p>

<h4>How Do I Install Sparforte?</h4>

<p>Follow the instructions in the INSTALL text file included with
your download.</p>

<h4>How Do I Report a Sparforte Bug?</h4>

<p>Follow the instructions in the Intro/Preface section of this
documentation.</p>

<h3>Common Problems</h3>

<h4>Why do I get an error when I run commands in backquotes?</h4>

<p>SparForte requires all commands to be terminated with a semi-colon.  This
includes commands in backquotes.</p>

<h4>Why do I get an error when I run a command with a long option on the command prompt?</h4>

<p>In a command like "ls --help", SparForte appends a semi-colon before
running the command.  But "--" is the comment symbol and the semi-colon
is hidden as part of the comment, producing a "shell word or semi-colon
expected" error.  The solution is to escape the double-minus.  For example,
use quotes around the long option, or backslashes before each minus sign,
or use AdaScript parameters.</p>

<h4>Why can't I use put_line, ?, etc. to start a command pipeline?</h4>

<p>There are 3 kinds of subprograms in Sparforte: commands, procedures
and functions.  Commands can have the I/O redirected.  Functions can
be used in expressions.  Procedures are stand-alone.  put_line and
related are procedures so they can't be used in a command pipeline.</p>

<h4>How do I convert strings to numbers?</h4>

<p>There are built-in functions to do this.  <tt>numerics.value</tt> converts
a string to its equivalent value: numerics.value("5") returns 5.
<tt>numerics.pos</tt> returns the ASCII value: numerics.pos( "A" )
returns 65.</p>

<h4>When I convert numbers to strings, why do they sometimes have a leading space character?</h4>

<p>For historical reasons, the Ada language uses a leading space for
positive numbers and a leading minus for negative numbers.  Sparforte
also follows this convention for GCC Ada compatibility.  So "?",
strings.image, put_line, etc. will put a leading space before a
positive number.</p>

<p>To remove the leading space, use strings.trim().</p>

<h4>How do I read in a number like scanf, readln, etc?</h4>

<p><tt>get_line</tt> only reads strings but you can convert the
string using <tt>numerics.value</tt> like this:</p>

<p><tt>n := numerics.value( get_line );</tt></p>

<h4>How do I format numbers like printf?</tt>?</h4>

<p>The built-in <tt>put</tt> procedure (not <tt>put_line</tt>) can
do this.  The optional final parameter is a picture string
describing the number's layout.  See the put in the package
section.</p>

<h4>How do I create a C-style string?</h4>

<p>Create a string and append an ASCII or Latin_1 NUL character.</p>

<pre>
  c_string1 : string := "This is a C string" &amp; ASCII.NUL
  c_string2 : string := "This is a C string" &amp; Latin_1.NUL
</pre>

<h4>What does it mean when a type is <tt>limited</tt>?</h4>

<p>A limited type is a type that cannot be assigned in an assignment
statement.  It can still be used in paramters.  Typically a limited
type is used to protect against "shallow copying" of data structures.
Although Sparforte has no pointers and thus no shallow copying issues,
some times are treated as limited
for compatibility with GCC Ada. An example is the
<tt>file_type</tt> type.</p>

<h4>How do I use an environment variable like <tt>LOGNAME</tt>?</h4>

<p>You have to import it first:</p>

<p><tt>LOGNAME : string;</tt><br><tt>pragma import( shell, LOGNAME );</tt></p>

<p>If you want to make LOGNAME available to other programs as an
environment variable, you'll also have to <tt>export</tt> it.</p>

<h4>What's the difference between an <tt>in</tt>, <tt>out</tt> and
<tt>in out</tt> parameters?</h4>

<p>An <tt>in</tt> parameter is one that is used by a subprogram but
will not be altered.  An <tt>out</tt> parameter is one that is
created by the subprogram and any initial value is ignored.  An
<tt>in out</tt> parameter is one that is used by the subprogram but
may be altered by the time the subprogram is finished.</p>

<p>There is no equivalent of pass-by-value or pass-by-reference.</p>

<h4>How do I change my command prompt?</h4>

<p>Use <tt>pragma prompt_script</tt>.  More information is in the
reference section.</p>

<h4>How do I run a command with spaces in the name?</h4>

<p>Put double quotes around the command name.</p>

<h4>How do I write a shell command over multiple lines?</h4>

<p>SparForte supports shell commands over multiple lines.  You do not use
a backslash at the end of a line as in a Bourne Shell.  For example,
these commands are the same:</p>

<span><tt>ls -l;</tt></span><br>
<span><tt>ls</tt></span><br>
<span><tt>-l;</tt></span><br>

<h4>How do I create session variables?</h4>

<p>Web session variables are on our to-do list.  In the meantime,
you can create your session variables yourself.  Create a file
in the /tmp directory.  Use a filename that is secure and
consistent for the user's session: for example,
the filename can be the MD5 value of the user's id.  Read and
write variables to this file.  Write a cron task to periodically
clean old files out of /tmp.  If performance is an issue, it
is a common trick on web servers to move /tmp to a ramdisk.</p>

<h4>Why can I only import and export string variables?</h4>

<p>Variables in SparForte may be of many different types and
the values are represented in ways specific to the language.
When Ken designed pragma import/export, strings were believed
to be the most fundamental way of transferring information
between SparForte and other languages.  In addition,
environment variables are actually strings.</p>

<p>However, passing a numeric variable through import and
export between SparForte scripts means converting the variable
to/from a string, which is inconvenient.  It is possible that
the importing/exporting other types of variables will be done in the
future.</p>

<h4>Can you do Continuous Integration with SparForte?</h4>

<p>CI is a technique were tests are automatically run on a regular basis to
detect errors as quickly as possible.  This requires a set of test programs
that can perform tests without human intervention.  Most CI frameworks
will run a shell command or script to start the tests.  As long as you can
create a start script and a set of test programs, you can use CI with
SparForte.</p>

<p>A very minimal test would be to use SparForte's syntax check feature to
check for syntax errors one time each night.</p>

<p>You can get a rough idea of test coverage by running SparForte with
the trace feature turned on.  This displays the lines the language reads,
not the lines it executes, but it will give you and idea a script is
doing during a test.</p>

<h3>Design Questions</h3>

<h4>Isn't Sparforte just another "my favourite language" shell?</h4>

<p>There are several open source shells such as Java's bean shell and
Perl's zoidberg.  These attempt to create shells with a structure
famillar to practicioners of those languages.</p>

<p>SpareForte chose compatibility with Ada because Ada was the only
top 20 language that had the capability to meet Sparforte's vision.
This is the same reason that NASA, aerospace, air traffic control,
robotics, and financial institutions chose Ada over Java, Perl, etc.</p>

<h4>Can strong typing be used successfully in a shell?</h4>

<p>Sparforte makes allowances by supplying universal types and
using "duck typing" when automatically declaring variables
at the command prompt.</p>

<h4>Why can't I undo <tt>pragma restriction</tt>, <tt>pragma ada_95</tt>, running in restricted shell mode, etc.?</h4>

<p>As a general rule, when restrictions are enforced they cannot be undone.
First, restrictions may be applied for security purposes.  Allowing them
to be undone would be a security risk.  Second, restrictions may be applied
for style or design reasons by architects or team leaders.  For example,
they might use pragma ada_95 make source code as reuseable as possible.  In
either case, the restrictions should not be undone.</p>

<h4>Where does the idea of "itself" come from?</h4>

<p>The itself operand was a part of "Pegasus Pascal", a Python-like
language Ken wrote for the Apple II in the mid-1990's before Ken
had heard of Python and before Python was popular.</p>

<h4>Why are there no objects or exceptions?</h4>

<p>Objects, exceptions, user-defined packages, etc. are scheduled to be added to Sparforte.  See the project roadmap map.</p>

<h4>Does the choice of language really improve productivity and reduce maintenance?</h4>

<p>Robert L. Glass, Tom Demacro and other industry leaders say that choice of
language doesn't have a significant impact on the product.</p>

<p>Most programming languages focus on implementation.  SparForte (and Ada,
the language SparForte is modelled on) includes features
that improve other stages of software building and facilliate team communication.
Ada has been shown in large studies to have productivity improvements as much as
double other programming languages.  Expect SparForte to address more of these
kind of time-consuming issues that other languages neglect.</p>
