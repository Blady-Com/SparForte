	<h2>Why It Works</h2>
	<h3>SparForte: Cowboy Coders Not Welcome</h3>

	<p>This is a high-level overview the SparForte and its goals.
	Do you want to see a SparForte script? Here is a short one.</p>


	<center>
	<div class="code">
		<p class="code">? "Hello World!";<br>&nbsp;<br></p>
	<div class="code_caption">
		<b>Example</b>: Hello World</span>
	</div>
	</div>
	</center>

	<p>There are many shells, interpreters, languages and web template systems.&nbsp;
	Virtually without exception, they are incompatible with one
	another.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	What's the point of learning a tool that, no matter how sophisticated
	it is, leaves your source code stuck with that particular tool.&nbsp; You
	want to do scripting, so you use Python or Scheme.&nbsp; You want to do
	reporting, so you use Perl or AWK.&nbsp; You want to write a command script, so you
	use Bash or Zsh.&nbsp; You want to write an applet, so you use Java.&nbsp; To be a
	programmer these days, you need to be fluent in a dozen different
	languages.&nbsp; You would be making more money if you got a job at the United Nations.
	</p>
	<p>The SparForte is different.&nbsp; It is part of a language
	environment called ABEE, one of the most powerful and flexible
	environments available for Linux today.  ABEE is built around a single language
	standard available on almost all Linux platforms, GCC Ada.  Any project you write in SparForte is immediately portable to
	any machine that GCC runs on.&nbsp;
	In other words, virtually everything.&nbsp; And it means that SparForte
	scripts
	can be compiled using GCC and everyone knows that GCC is superior to
	most
	commercial compilers.
	</p>

      <td>
      <pre><b>procedure</b> hello <b>is</b>

</p>
<p>You don't have to rewrite your scripts to use them in applications.
Use the same variable types, the same structures, the same built-in
packages.  Cut-and-paste your code.</p>
<p>If that's not enough, using the JGNAT open
source compiler, you can even compile your SparForte scripts into actual
Java
bytecode.&nbsp; There is another tool, A#, that will compile scripts
into
.NET byte code&nbsp; Things don't get much more platform-independent
than
that.
</p>
<p>What about PHP? SparForte has a HTML template engine that runs embedded
scripts in a secure environment. No need to worry about users messing
with
your code...unless you want them to.
</p>
<p>
<table summary="" bgcolor="white" border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%">

    <tr>
      <td>
      <pre><b>&lt;html&gt;</b>
<b>&lt;head&gt;</b>
<b>&lt;title&gt;</b>SparForte script embedded in a web page<b>&lt;/title&gt;</b>

<b>&lt;body&gt;</b>

    </tr>
  </tbody>

</p>
<p>It's the same SparForte source code that you use for your scripts.  No need
to learn a special template language with a new set of rules.</p>
<p>But SparForte does more than just create scripts, executable programs and
Java applets.&nbsp; It's a powerful computer language on its own able
to
do complex math, manipulate files, generate reports and able to do
network
programming.&nbsp; And there are many built-in packages that will let you
do everything from compute trig functions to connecting to a web server.
</p>
<p>But best of all, SparForte is easy.&nbsp; Perl claims to be easy.&nbsp;
Easily
like riding a bicycle backwards in the middle of a thunderstorm.&nbsp;
SparForte is easy to read, easy to understand.&nbsp; You know exactly what a
script does without having to have a reference book beside you at all
times
</p>
<p>SparForte doesn't run your programs outright.&nbsp; First it examines
them,
compresses them, and converts them into intermediate code.&nbsp;
(That's
"byte code", to you Java developers.) SparForte optimizes the program for
the
best possible performance. It also takes the time to verify your
program
will run before attempting to execute the first line.
</p>
<p>And if you make to typing mistake, SparForte will let you know before
running
your program.&nbsp; There's no need to worry that your typo will be a
valid
command like it would be in most other languages.&nbsp; SparForte works for
you, not against you.
</p>
<p>One tool for all solutions.
</p>
<p>And, yes, SparForte is also makes a pretty good shell.
</p>
<p>So you basically have two choices. Keep working for the U.N., or
give SparForte a try and make your life a little easier.</p>

<h3><a name="install"></a>1.2 Installation</h3>

<p>SparForte requires the GCC Ada (GNAT) run-time library and the standard C library.
To compile SparForte from sources, you will also need BASH, GNU make and GCC Ada.
SparForte was developed on Linux but has been ported to some other platforms.</p>

<p>SparForte has additional requirements depending on what features are
enabled.</p>

<p>For further information, check the INSTALL file included with the SparForte
sources.</p>

<p>The source files and some pre-built versions can be downloaded from the SparForte
home page at
<a href="http://www.pegasoft.ca/bush.html">http://www.pegasoft.ca/bush.html</a>.</p>
<p>Complete installation details are in the README and INSTALL files
included in the SparForte download file.</p>

<h3><a name="tech"></a>Technical Introduction</h3>
<p>Scripting languages are increasingly popular in commercial work, particularily
in web design.  Some of the problems encountered with today's scripting
languages include area of:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Code Reuse</b> - sharing source code between the client or server,
templates or applications, or other software developers requires fundamental
change in syntax or semantics, preventing code reuse.</li>
<li><b>Training</b> - software developers must be trained in a variety of
languages each with its own non-standard syntax and unique terminology.
This leads to confusion and prevents peer review.</li>
<li><b>Modal Thinking</b> - software developers are proned, when
using similar languages, to use the syntax of one language when progrmming in a
different language.  This results in statements that are semantically correct
but syntactically wrong for a particular tool.</li>
<li><b>Code Aging</b> - related to scalability, script tend to evolve over time
outstripping the capabilities of the original languages.  These legacy
scripts need to be ported to a different environment which often requires
a complete rewrite into a different language.</li>
<li><b>Design Standardization</b> - what I refer to as the "Kitchen
Sink Syndrome".  Many scripting languages have begin as a project to solve a
particular issue.  For example, Python was created to be easy to use and Perl
was an amalgamation of several UNIX tools.  As the languages age,
new features are added that corrupt the original design goals.  Python is no longer easy
to use.  Perl's syntax conflicts with the original UNIX tools that inspired it.
This is results in similar but incompatible tools with unclear goals.</li>
<li><b>Reliability</b> - many scripting tools have poor error checking and
error-prone syntaxes which require longer testing times and greater chances
of latent run-time errors. Testing applications in these languages require
testing not only high-level functionality but also additional tests for
low-level language issues.</li>
</ul>
<p>Many of these problems can be reduced by using a common development
language for web pages, scripting and application building.  Many languages,
including Java and Perl, offer this kind of capability.</p>
<p>However, comparisons of software development languages, such as
Rational Software's 2005 study by Zeigler
(<a href="http://www.adaic.com/whyada/ada-vs-c/cada_art.html">study</a>)
demonstrate that languages designed for correctness, code reuse and
easy maintenance (so called "software engineering" languages) greatly reduce
costs for businesses.</p>
<p>(Supporters of languages like Perl argue that less typing is the key to
reducing costs.  However, as the size and complexity of projects grow, the
time to type is less significant that the cost of design and bug fixing).</p>
<p>PegaSoft's SparForte is a scripting language, template engine and
command prompt that is designed to solve these issues and allow faster
development of large-scale web applications compared to other popular tools.</p>

<h3><a name="abee"></a>Ada-SparForte Enterprise Endeavor (ABEE)</h3>
<p>As long as the command prompt, compiled applications, web templates and
scripts remain in fundamental dischord, these issues will be difficult to
solve.  These development tools cannot agree even on basic issues as
to what constitutes a boolean, the working of a for loop, or the syntax for
an associative array.  There needs to be some structural design agreement
between the development tools in order to create an enterprise-wide, open
source software environment standard.</p>

<p>The standard proposed by PegaSoft is called the <b>Ada-SparForte Enterprise
Endeavor (ABEE)</b>.  SparForte is part of a set of tools built around the ISO
Ada standard to create a standardized framework for create applications.
The other tools include:

</p><ul>
<li><b>GCC/GNAT</b> - to create compiled applications</li>
<li><b>JGNAT</b> - to create JVM byte code</li>
<li><b>A#</b> - to create .Net applets</li>
<li><b>SparForte</b> - command prompt, template engine and scripts</li>
</ul>

<p>Together, these tools compose a standardized framework for developing web
templates, server applications, client side JVM and .Net applets, scripts
and enterprise-wide computing.  In all cases, the basic data types,
control structures and libraries available to the developer have the same
names, the same syntax and the same semantics.  A boolean at the command
prompt is like a boolean in a script is like a boolean in an HTML template
and so forth.  There is agreement at a fundamental structural level between
the development tools.  This agreement promotes code reuse, simplifies
training and peer review, reduces modal thinking errors, makes code age-able
and scalable.</p>

<p>ABEE also serves as an open source alternative to proprietary offerings
like ASP .Net and Sun's J2EE.</p>

<p>In order to achieve standardization, ABEE uses the Ada 95 language.
Ada 95 is the only open source language that provides all of the following
functionality:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Standardized</b> - Ada is an ISO standard which gives the language
long life and compatibility between different vendors.
</li><li><b>Enterprise Features</b> - Ada is a language designed to handle large,
complex applications.  It has extensive features for structuring and testing
multi-developer projects.</li>
<li><b>Strong Error Checking</b> - Ada puts a strong emphasis on catching as
many errors as possible at compile-time, reducing run-time errors and improving
reliability</li>
<li><b>Widely Available</b> - GCC has native Ada support and is included with
most versions of BSD's and Linux.</li>
<li><b>Easily Read and Understood</b> - The syntax of the language avoids
cryptic symbols and promotes code review.</li>
<li><b>Good Performance</b> - GCC Ada binary executables runs at comparable
speeds to GCC C.</li>
<li><b>Open Source</b> - The source code to GCC and SparForte is freely available.</li>
<li><b>Industry Recognized</b> - GNAT Pro, the commercially supported version
of GCC Ada, was a runner up for the <u>Datamation's Enterprise Linux Product of
the Year Award for 2005</u>.<p></p>
</li></ul>

<p>The following chart shows how ABEE can be divided into a multi-tier web
development framework:</p>
<p>&nbsp;
</p>

</center>
<p><i><b>Figure</b>: ABEE Multitier Enterprise Application Model
</i></p>
<p><b><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Client-Side
Presentation</span></span></b><br>
</p>
<p>On a user's desktop, native Ada 95 applications can be
created with the Win32 version of Ada Core Techologies'
GNAT (another name for GCC Ada) or one of the commercial desktop Ada
compilers.&nbsp; Alternatively JVM applications can be created with Ada
Core Technologies' <b>JGNAT</b> Java byte code compiler.&nbsp;
Or create .Net applications using <b>A#</b>, the Ada .Net
compiler.&nbsp; You
can also create JVM or .Net applets to run in a client's web
browser.&nbsp; In all these cases, using Ada means that developers need
to know only one core language.</p>
<p><b><span style="font-weight: bold;">Server-Side Presentation<br>
</span></b></p>
<p>The web server can use SparForte web
templates to create web pages with embedded AdaScript code.&nbsp; Like
JSP, ASP, PHP and similar products, SparForte can connect to databases and
generate new web content dynamically.&nbsp; SparForte templates can
communicate to the other layers by opening TCP/IP sockets (for remote
machines) or by files (on local machines).&nbsp; Using AdaScript for
your templates means that developments use the same core language as
used in the other layers.<br>
</p>
<p><b><span style="font-weight: bold;">Server-Side Business Logic<br>
</span></b></p>
<p>To manage and cache information, compiled applications and server
software can be built using GCC Ada.&nbsp; The server software gain the
speed advantage of binary code for the host machine while still being
able to communicate with the other tiers through files, TCP/IP
sockets.&nbsp; Cluster computer can be done using GCC Ada's GLADE
environment: GLADE partitions a single application over multiple
computers without worrying about the underlying operating system.&nbsp;
You can also share objects using Ada's CORBA implementation.&nbsp;
Process control and information flow can be coordinated by SparForte scripts.</p>
<p><b><span style="font-weight: bold;">Enterprise Information Systems<br>
</span></b></p>
<p>SparForte has integrated support for SQL so there usually no reason to
reply
on a database client program. The stored procedure language for most
databases is very similar to AdaScript and is intuitive to learn and
use
if developers are already familiar with ABEE. The database package with
SparForte
is also available with GCC Ada applications.</p>
<p></p>
<p>
At each layer, developers will need to know only one core language,
with the same basic constructions and types.&nbsp; For example, a "for
loop" is written the same way in any tier, whether for a .Net
application or a SparForte web template.&nbsp; This reduces training costs
and makes source code portable between the tiers over solutions that
require different languages at each tier.&nbsp; In addition, the same
core packages are available (string handling, math, lock file handling,
I/O, and others).</p>
<p><b><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></span></span></b>
</p>
<p>In comparison, consider Sun's <b>Java 2 Enterprise Edition</b>
(J2EE) environment.&nbsp;
Java "components" (small
applications)
can be distributed across an information system using secure
connections
to negotiate with one another. Ignoring Sun's marketing buzzwords, you
can see that the open source ABEE approach is as good as or superior to
J2EE:
</p>
<ul>
  <li> <b>multitiered applications</b> - Ada applications and SparForte
scripts
can
be distributed across multiple machines and accessed using secure
connections
using proven technologies.&nbsp; Ada applications can be multithreaded
and can multiplex requests from multiple sources the same way as Java
applications.&nbsp;
Scripts can handle multiple requests through multiple user
sessions--SparForte
features such as the Lock_Files package can ensure coordinated access
to
files.</li>
  <li> <b>J2EE applications</b> - Java can partition large
applications
across
multiple machines transparently.&nbsp; So can GCC Ada using the GLADE
distributed
application tool.</li>
  <li> <b>Java servlets</b> - GCC Ada and SparForte both have support for
creating
servlets (web server applications).</li>
  <li> <b>EJB (Enterprise Java Beans)</b> - the tools to implement
secure
communication
between processes and machines have long been available under Linux,
adhering
to industry standards such as CORBA and not requiring proprietary
systems
like the ones Java uses.</li>
</ul>
<p>J2EE is not your only solution for writing multitiered enterprise
applications.&nbsp;
The ABEE strategy offers the same advantages as solutions offered by
Sun.
Reusable components, client interaction using HTML/XML/HTTP,
scalability
and high availability over a network are all possible with an ABEE
strategy. Ada-SparForte allows applications to be written once and run
everywhere,
supports CORBA technology to interface with existing enterprise
resources,
and creates a single standard that can be use effectively throughout an
enterprise. Plus you get to use a truly scalable language system that
cuts
down training expenses and allows applications to be "scaled up" with
minimum
effort.</p>
<h3><a name="comm"></a>Commercial Options</h3>
<p>GCC Ada is available in an award-winning, commercial, supported edition
called GNAT Pro.</p>
<p>Aonix produces a commercial Ada compiler for Linux and other platforms.</p>
</p></p>
<h3><a name="prob1"></a>How SparForte Improves Code Reuse</h3>
<p>To further illustrate SparForte's advantages over other popular tools, let us
examine some of the issues raised in section 1.2 in detail.</p>

<p>The fundamental differents in syntax or semantics between different web
development tools has led to difficulties in sharing source code between
applications or developers.  Consider the issue of null or undefined variables
which have no associated value, string concatenation and array referencing.</p>

<p>The conventional C, Perl, PHP or BASH shell solution have no agreement on
these basic features:</p>

<table summary="Language Features" border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="1">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>&nbsp;<b>Feature</b>&nbsp;</td>
      <td>&nbsp;<b>GCC C Application</b>&nbsp;</td>
      <td>&nbsp;<b>Perl Script</b>&nbsp;</td>
      <td>&nbsp;<b>PHP Template</b>&nbsp;</td>
      <td>&nbsp;<b>Shell Prompt</b>&nbsp;</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>&nbsp;<i>Undefined Variables</i>&nbsp;</td>
      <td bgcolor="lightgrey">never</td>
      <td bgcolor="lightgrey">var == undef</td>
      <td bgcolor="lightgrey">empty()</td>
      <td bgcolor="lightgrey">-z (null string)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>&nbsp;<i>String Concatenation</i>&nbsp;</td>
      <td bgcolor="lightgrey">strcat/strncat</td>
      <td bgcolor="lightgrey">. or word expansion</td>
      <td bgcolor="lightgrey">.</td>
      <td bgcolor="lightgrey">word expansion</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>&nbsp;<i>Arrays</i>&nbsp;</td>
      <td bgcolor="lightgrey">fixed size, 0-based index</td>
      <td bgcolor="lightgrey">variable size, 0-based index</td>
      <td bgcolor="lightgrey">variable size, 0-based index or strings</td>
      <td bgcolor="lightgrey">variable size, 0-based index</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Moving source code between these tools is inherently difficult even though
they are often employed simultaenously for a web-based application.</p>

<p>The ABEE solution using SparForte provides fundamental consistency across these
features:</p>

<table summary="Language Features" border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="1">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>&nbsp;<b>Feature</b>&nbsp;</td>
      <td>&nbsp;<b>GCC Ada</b>&nbsp;</td>
      <td>&nbsp;<b>SparForte Script</b>&nbsp;</td>
      <td>&nbsp;<b>SparForte Template</b>&nbsp;</td>
      <td>&nbsp;<b>SparForte Prompt</b>&nbsp;</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>&nbsp;<i>Undefined Variables</i>&nbsp;</td>
      <td bgcolor="white">never</td>
      <td bgcolor="white">never</td>
      <td bgcolor="white">never</td>
      <td bgcolor="white">never</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>&nbsp;<i>String Concatenation</i>&nbsp;</td>
      <td bgcolor="white">&amp;</td>
      <td bgcolor="white">&amp;</td>
      <td bgcolor="white">&amp;</td>
      <td bgcolor="white">&amp;</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>&nbsp;<i>Arrays</i>&nbsp;</td>
      <td bgcolor="white">fixed size, integer or enumerated index</td>
      <td bgcolor="white">fixed size, integer or enumerated index</td>
      <td bgcolor="white">fixed size, integer or enumerated index</td>
      <td bgcolor="white">fixed size, integer or enumerated index</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Source code can be moved from application to template, or template to
script, or script to command prompt without breaking the code.</p>

<h3><a name="prob2"></a>How SparForte Eases Training</h3>

<p>Many of the different tools employ their own unique syntax for features
that are essentially the same.  In the preceeding section it was demonstrated
how features, even very basic ones, are used in incompatible ways.  However
these tools often use their own unique terminology.</p>

<p>Consider how popular scripting languages declare a subprogram:</p>

<table summary="Language Terminology" border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="1">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>&nbsp;<b>Terminology</b>&nbsp;</td>
      <td>&nbsp;<b>GCC C Application</b>&nbsp;</td>
      <td>&nbsp;<b>Perl Script</b>&nbsp;</td>
      <td>&nbsp;<b>PHP Template</b>&nbsp;</td>
      <td>&nbsp;<b>Shell Prompt</b>&nbsp;</td>
      <td>&nbsp;<b>Python Script</b>&nbsp;</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>&nbsp;<i>Subprogram Declaration</i>&nbsp;</td>
      <td bgcolor="lightgrey">function (<u>type</u> <u>name</u> ...)</td>
      <td bgcolor="lightgrey">subroutine (sub)</td>
      <td bgcolor="lightgrey">function</td>
      <td bgcolor="lightgrey">function (<u>name</u>() ...)</td>
      <td bgcolor="lightgrey">function (def)</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>People using these languages cannot even agree on what to call a routine
with a name because there's no consistent terminology.  When one developer
refers to a def and another refers to a sub, how can they understand one
another?</p>

<p>SparForte and ABEE tools have consistent terminology:</p>

<table summary="Language Terminology" border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="1">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>&nbsp;<b>Terminology</b>&nbsp;</td>
      <td>&nbsp;<b>GCC Ada Application</b>&nbsp;</td>
      <td>&nbsp;<b>SparForte Script</b>&nbsp;</td>
      <td>&nbsp;<b>SparForte Template</b>&nbsp;</td>
      <td>&nbsp;<b>SparForte Prompt</b>&nbsp;</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>&nbsp;<i>Subprogram Declaration</i>&nbsp;</td>
      <td bgcolor="white">procedure or function</td>
      <td bgcolor="white">procedure or function</td>
      <td bgcolor="white">procedure or function</td>
      <td bgcolor="white">procedure or function</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>It is easy to see how programmers can be divided into camps by this
modern day "Tower of Babel", all taking about the same issues but unable
to express the issues in common terminology.</p>

<h3><a name="prob3"></a>How SparForte Reduces Modal Thinking</h3>

<p>When programmers try to use similar but incompatible languages on a single
project, they run the risk of using the wrong syntax for the current
language they are using.  What they type is correct...if they were using
something else.</p>

<p>Here's an example using string and numerical equality.  Scripting languages
that are "typeless" require different operator to compare strings and numbers:</p>

<table summary="Language Modes" border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="1">
  <tbody>

<p>Notice the problem of Perl and Shell: they both use "eq" <u>but for
opposite uses</u>.  A single equal sign is sometimes used for assignment or
comparision.  A double equal sign can be used for either string or numeric
comparision, depending on the language.</p>

<p>Compare this to ABEE approach with SparForte:</p>

<p>There is a consistent way to compare strings or numbers across the scripts,
applications, templates and command prompt.  There is no danger of accidently
using the wrong operator when you are looking at the wrong type of source
code.</p>

<h3><a name="prob4"></a>How SparForte Manages Code Aging--The Progressive Development Model</h3>

SparForte recognizes a fundamental problem in business programming.
Programmers
with limited time and resources are often required to write up quick
scripts
to solve pressing business problems. Once the script is written, they
have
no time to return to the script to write a "proper" solution. Scripts,
designed for rapid and simple solutions, continue to grow and mutate,
becoming
rapidly unreadable and easily broken, leaving a complete rewrite in a
different
language as the only way to upgrade the software.
<p>To combat this problem, SparForte scripts can be developed using a
progressive
development model.
</p>
<p>In its native mode, SparForte provides a quick and easy environment to
write
short Linux programs. Like BASH, Perl, PHP or Python, variables can be declared anywhere and
can be typeless. Although its structure is relaxed compared to a
compiled
programming language, SparForte's syntax is both easy to read and
provides much more security against typing errors.  Common
errors in these other scripting languages such as missing a quotation or spelling mistakes on
variable
names are quickly caught.
</p>
<p>As an SparForte script grows over time, becoming longer and carring more
responsibility, the structure of the script can be improved by using
"pragma
ada_95". This SparForte directive disables many of the "lazy" features
such as typeless variables and requires closer conformation to GCC Ada.
A programmer can "tighten" his code as part of his regular duties,
add type checking, and ensure that the script's structure is sound and
the source is readable without resorting to a complete rewrite.  Some
important scripting features, like running commands in the background
with "&amp;", are still allowed.
</p>
<p>Finally, if the SparForte script continues to grow and is no longer
suitable
as a script, the script can be compiled with minimum changes as an Ada
program. With other shells and scripting languages, a developer would
have
no choice but to rewrite the script "from scratch".
</p>
<p>SparForte also has built-in obsolecense control using "pragma deprecated"
(or "pragma depreciated").  This marks obsolete scripts or templates being
phased out of a project, allowing them to be removed in a controlled manner
without disrupting the project.</p>

<h3><a name="prob5"></a>How SparForte Provides Design Standardization</h3>

<p>SparForte is designed to be compliant with the ISO standard.  Each version
of SparForte moves closer to this goal.  As SparForte adds new features, they are
implemented based on a recognized internation standard, not based on the
language designer's whims.</p>

<table summary="Language Irregularities" border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="1">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>&nbsp;<b>Feature</b>&nbsp;</td>
      <td>&nbsp;<b>GCC C Application</b>&nbsp;</td>
      <td>&nbsp;<b>Perl Script</b>&nbsp;</td>
      <td>&nbsp;<b>PHP Template</b>&nbsp;</td>
      <td>&nbsp;<b>Shell Prompt</b>&nbsp;</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>&nbsp;<i>String Searching</i>&nbsp;</td>
      <td bgcolor="lightgrey">strstr</td>
      <td bgcolor="lightgrey">Perl grep</td>
      <td bgcolor="lightgrey">strstr</td>
      <td bgcolor="lightgrey">Shell grep or $ exprssions</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>This kind of inconstent behaviour is a result of the "kitchen sink
syndrome": throwing in features from different sources without thought to
the overall impact on the language.  Perl and Shell use grep, but they
are not the same grep.  C and PHP uses strstr but the strings behave
somewhat differently.</p>

<p>SparForte and ABEE languages share one function with a common name:</p>

<table summary="Language Irregularities" border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="1">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>&nbsp;<b>Feature</b>&nbsp;</td>
      <td>&nbsp;<b>GCC Ada Application</b></td>
      <td>&nbsp;<b>SparForte Prompt</b></td>
      <td>&nbsp;<b>SparForte Script</b></td>
      <td>&nbsp;<b>SparForte Template</b></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>&nbsp;<i>String Searching</i>&nbsp;</td>
      <td bgcolor="white">strings.<u>string_type</u>.index</td>
      <td bgcolor="white">strings.index</td>
      <td bgcolor="white">strings.index</td>
      <td bgcolor="white">strings.index</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
  </tr></tbody>
</table>

<p>(In SparForte there is only one string type so the type name is omitted.)</p>

<p>SparForte avoids the feature creep that affects even common library functions
but following a recognized standard.</p>

<h3><a name="prob6"></a>How SparForte Improves Reliability</h3>

<p>Most scripting languages have forsaken reliability for convenience.
Popular justifications for this are:
</p><ul>
<li>"Smaller" source code means "a reduced target for errors".</li>
<li>Languages should do what you mean not what you say.</li>
<li>You have to write test suites (and, perhaps, code review) anyway, so why
have a language that tries to help you?</li>
</ul>

<p>However, studies have not backed up these claims.  There have been numerous
studies, particularly between C and Ada, that demonstrate that Ada developers
complete projects faster and have fewer errors.  Ada is a language designed
for reliability.  For example, an in-depth 1995 study by Stephen F. Zeigler
(http://www.adaic.com/docs/reports/cada/cada_art.html) showed that development
in Ada costs about half that of C++. It also suggests that Ada produces
"almost 90% fewer bugs for the final customer".</p>

<p>SparForte complies to the Ada languages for high reliability and implements
a number of security features that restrict what scripts and templates can
and cannot do.  SparForte implements strong typing, explicit type conversion and
required variable declarations because these are basic features in the war on
bugs.  Saving a few seconds on typing is not worth a few hours of debugging.</p>

<p>For example, consider the issue called "type juggling".  If there are two
alternatives for automatic type conversion, the programmer must try to guess
which conversion the language will use.  This can have unusual side-effects
such as in PHP where "hello" == 0 is false but in Perl it is true.  This
kind of problem cannot occur in SparForte.</p>

<p>For another example, not having to declare variables or their types saves
a few keystrokes.  However, the savings is an illusion as you have to use
different operators (effectively declaring the types) in expressions.  Without
declared variables and types, the language is left without redundant
information to identify many common mistakes.</p>

<p>When you run a short SparForte script and SparForte does not complain, there is a
good chance the script will work properly the first time "out of the box".
With other tools, you are rolling dice.</p>
