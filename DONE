Release focus: removing barrier to adoption.

pen.new_gl_window_canvas( h, v, r, c )

pen.new_gl_screen_canvas - untested

enums.prev -> fixed to enums.pred

? displays integer values when reasonable to do so (e.g. 41.0
is shown as 40)

---

Removing barriers to adoption:

border="0" missing from some up-arrows in the docs.
links in ref packages must be reviewed.

aligncols broken: for Align in Left..Right loop: doesn't properly
distinguish between "Align" and enumerated items between Left..Right

That is:
=> type align is (left, center, right )
=> for i in left..right loop ? i ; end loop;
left
i
i
testing is separate and other features backported ported from 2.0
but not tested

enums package works but ? displays numbers instead of literals...why?
enums.pos() and enums.val() not implemented yet

pragma restriction( no_mysql );
pragma restriction( no_postgresql );
pragma initialize_scalars;

implement other gnatprep stuff?

SkipBlock won't show trace line because it's syntax_checking.  But how do we
know if we're at the start of a new line and need to output it?  Could be on
one line.

integer casting
  - params and return values not done

Displays lines as read but also non-executed lines
  Need to flag if anything on line executes and then display line
Timestamps would allow performance analysis
