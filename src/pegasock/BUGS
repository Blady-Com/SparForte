- NOTE: Tinyserver now returns socket on connection (in Bush, doesn't)

- tinyserve's specification should be cleaned up

- EOL handling for two characters needs to be fixed (right now only checks
  for final character on a two-character EOL sequence).  First char could
  no longer be in buffer if read buffer was updated, so it has to be flagged.
  This is pretty inefficient if it can be avoided.

- use of asynchronous I/O (C rt library has aio_cancel(3), aio_error(3),
  aio_fsync(3), aio_read(3), aio_return(3), aio_suspend(3))
  - O_ASYNC on open sends a signal (SIGIO) when a pipe is free for writing.
    Must write a C signal catcher to flag when operations on a socket are
    complete. (Good for game server talking back to clients.)

- use of poll(2) to determine if a file can be written to (if non-blocking).
  (like tinyserve's may not block function)

Create syslog client
Create redis client

Create high-end server (gigaserve?) to correspond to tinyserve
