PegaSock (PegaSoft Ada Sockets)

A thick Ada binding on basic non-streaming networking sockets and some
services commonly used by web applications such as HTTP.  This package
is modelled on Text_IO and uses similar function and procedure names
(such as Get, Put, Close).

If you want a thin binding, consider adasockets.
(www.rfc1149.net/devel/adasockets)

PegaSock is arranged into child packages:

pegasock - socket (and file) functions
pegasock-http - HTTP protocol functions
pegasock-memcache - basic Memcached client for 2:1 read/write ratio
pegasock-memcached-highread - a Memcached client for 4:1 read/write ratio
pegasock-smtp - simple mail transport protocol
pegasock-syslog - syslog-ng support
pegasoft-tinyserve - a lightweight socket server

Requirements

- GCC Ada with Ada 2005 support (any modern GCC)
- Linux

Edit O/S defs and provide the correct settings for your operation
system (I haven't written a configuration program yet).
