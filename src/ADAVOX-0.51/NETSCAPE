NETSCAPE SETUP :
----------------

To have adavox play *.wav files for you in NETSCAPE,
perform the following (Netscape 4.76 is assumed)

   1. Start Netscape :

   2. From the menu EDIT, select "Preferences.."

   3. In the "Category" box, expand the "Navigator"
      selection (the triangle at left will point
      down).

   4. Click on "Applications" beneath "Navigator".

   5. Scroll through the Applications list box,
      to find the Description "WAV Audio". Click
      on that line.

   6. Click the "Edit" button below the list box.

   7. In the "Handled By" group box, click the
      Application radio button.

   8. Type in "adavox %s" in the text box, and
      click the OK button.

   9. Click OK in the Netscape preferences dialog
      box, and you are ready.

For *.au/*.snd file support, follow the same
general procedure, with the following exceptions:

   For "ULAW Audio" use "adavox -a %s"

   This will play most *.au files, including
   PCM and a-Law files.
   
                     - End -
