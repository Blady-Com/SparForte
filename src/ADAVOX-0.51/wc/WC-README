       WHAT ARE THESE wc-*.ad[sb] FILES?
--------------------------------------------------
            Warren W. Gay VE3WWG


The wc-*.ad[sb] files form a subset of the
"Warren's Components" library. Rather than tie all
packages directly to the application program, a
number of the packages have been collected under
the WC umbrella for more general use.

  		    - * -
These files are protected under the terms of the GPL.

If you find them useful, you may link your own
applications to them. For example, the package
WC.Streams.Wave allows your application to read a
wave file. Package WC.Streams.DSP allows you to
write to the /dev/dsp device using Ada streams.
WC.Streams.Endian allows you to build an endian
neutral stream (for most platforms at least).

There exists no current documentation for these
packages. Its in the "someday plans" pile. ;-)

Suggestions, fixes, patches, and kind comments are
are always welcome. Send these to:

	ve3wwg@home.com

or if I should change ISPs someday, try :

	ve3wwg@yahoo.com
