            SECURITY (setuid) NOTE:
            -----------------------

You can remove the setuid bit without causing adavox to
fail -- it will continue to work without it. Some
administrators do not like any more setuid programs
than is absolutely necessary, with good security
reason.

The setuid root bit is used to permit adavox to
set a reailtime priority for itself. This makes it
less likely that "gap noises" will be heard when the
system is busy.

Note however, that adavox runs under its real userid
as soon as the realtime priority has been established
at program startup. This reduces the scope of the
security risk.
