		INSTALLATION OF ADAVOX 0.51

PREQUESITES :
-------------

   1. Installed and functional sound card
   2. Installed and functional O/S sound support
   3. Sound device node :

      This software will assume the device name
      /dev/dsp. If your system uses a different
      name, create a symlink to it (or modify the
      source code). Optionally, you can specify the
      option on the command line instead, to override.

   4. Permissions to write to the sound device
   5. Installed GNAT compiler (tested with 3.13p)

      This is necessary to compile the Ada95 source
      code modules.

   6. GNAT packages and libraries that go with the
      compiler. These are normally included with the
      compiler install.


SYSTEM CHECKS:
--------------

   1. Check existance of /dev/dsp (see #3 above)

         # ls -l /dev/dsp

      If it's not there, time to create a symlink:

         # ln -s /dev/my_audio_device /dev/dsp   

   2. Check permissions for read/write :

         # ls -lL /dev/dsp

      While the adavox program is installed setuid
      root (by default), it runs under the real
      userid after setting realtime scheduling
      priority at startup. Therefore, the userid(s)
      that run adavox should have read/write access
      to the device node.

   3. Check GNAT compiler:

      See install step 2b, below.


BIG ENDIAN USERS :
------------------

   If you are installing adavox on a big-endian
   host like the Sparc/MIPS/PowerPC, I'd like to
   hear about your experiences (good or bad). I'll
   do my best to address issues for you.


COMPILE AND INSTALL PROCEDURE :
-------------------------------

   NOTE : If you encountered problems and
         need to start over, just do a
         "make clobber" first. This will
         eliminate all trace of a prior
         build attempt. Repeat the build
         process by starting at step # 3.

   1. Unpack the media (compressed tar file)
      This will create a subdirectory ./ADAVOX-0.51

      $ tar xzvf adavox-0.51.tar.gz

   2a.Change to directory ./ADAVOX-0.51

      $ cd ./ADAVOX-0.51

   2b.Optional: Test your GNAT compiler.

         $ make test

      If it compiles and runs successfully, you
      should see the message:

         Hello, GNAT seems to work.

      The above message should confirm that your
      GNAT (Ada95) compiler is working.

      You may not have the compiler installed.

      If you have GNAT installed, and still
      this test fails, please consult with
      comp.os.lang.ada and other support forums.
      Site http://www.adapower.com is another
      good starting place.

      Feel free to contact me if the software has
      compiling issues, once you have taken the
      necessary steps to insure your compiler is
      working properly.

   3. Decide on options. Defaults are:

	INSTDIR=/usr/local/bin
	CPU=pentiumpro
	OPTZ=
	GNATOPTS=-gnato -gnata

      which are the suggested values to use.

      To compile for debug, set OPTZ=-g .
      
      WARNING:

      Do not compile with greater optimization
      than OPTZ=-O0 . GNAT 3.13p/gcc has a bug
      compiling ./wc/wc-streams-endian.adb
      when greater optimization is used.

      Greatest Optimization:

         OPTZ=-O0
         GNATOPTS=-gnatp

      Option -gnatp turns off all Ada checks,
      which is not recommended. The default
      permits software problems to be detected.

      You may want full optimization after
      considerable successful experience.

   4. Make (root is discouraged here)

      Default configuration:

         $ make

      A custom configuration example:

         $ make CPU=486

   5. Change to root

         $ su

   6. Install

      The following installs /usr/local/bin/adavox

         # make install

      To install as /opt/local/bin/adavox

         # make INSTDIR=/opt/local/bin install

   7. Perform a simple command test :

         $ adavox -h
         ADAVOX Release 0.51, Warren W. Gay VE3WWG

         Usage: adavox [-h] [-v] [-a file] [-w file] [-d dsp] [-R p] files...
         where:
            -v            Verbose
            -a file       Play file as *.au file
            -w file       Play file as *.wav file
            -d dsp        Overrides default of /dev/dsp
            -R p          Use realtime priority p
   
            -h            Requests this info.

         All remaining files are interpreted according to the
         file suffix.

   8. Test a wave file :

         $ adavox -v yahoo.wav
         ADAVOX Release 0.51, Warren W. Gay VE3WWG

         File        : yahoo.wav
         Type        : CODEC_LINEAR_U8
         Channels    : 1
         Sample Rate : 8000 Hz
         Sample Size : 8 bits
