# This is a demonstration Search File list for search.adb.
# You'll need to put this in a directory that can be accessed
# by the "search" sample CGI program.
# If you don't change "search.adb", this search file list
# must be placed in "/home/httpd/srchlist".
#
# Obviously, comments in this file begin with '#' and end at the end-of-line.
#
# The format of this file is:
#     <FILENAME>,<EXTERNAL NAME>
# where <FILENAME> is the local filename, and <EXTERNAL NAME> is the
# name that the user will see.  The comma is the separator; that means that
# filenames can't have commas in them, sorry.
