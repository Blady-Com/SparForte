The SID for the Ada binding to CGI follows.

I'd appreciate it if you would make the file
cgi.html "visible" outside of the ZIP formatted file
so that people can link directly to it.  I plan to
create many links from many non-Ada places directly to
the HTML file in the PAL.

%SHORT DESCRIPTION
Ada 95 binding to CGI (Common Gateway Interface).

%=ABSTRACT
Package CGI is an Ada 95 interface to the
Common Gateway Interface (CGI).
This package makes it easier to create Ada programs that can be
invoked by World-Wide-Web (WWW) HTTP servers using the standard CGI interface.
Using it, you can create Ada programs that perform queries or other processing
by request from a WWW user.
 
This package is copyright (C) 1995 David A. Wheeler (wheeler@ida.org).
You are free to use it in anything you wish without restriction or payment,
but please provide credit if you use this package.
 
This Ada package provides two data access approaches from the CGI:
* As an associative array; simply provide the key name (as a string) and the
  value associated with that key will be returned.
* As a sequence of key-value pairs, indexed from 1 to Argument_Count.
This access approach is similar to the Ada library Ada.Command_Line.

The main access routines support both Ada 95 types String and Unbounded_String.
