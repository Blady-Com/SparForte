SparForte (Business Shell) READ ME File
---------------------------------------

COPYING contains information about the GPL licence.
The SparForte documentation is located in the doc/ directory.

AdaCGI is released under the GPL licence.  The only changes were to
add the "-q" flag in the makefile for quieter makes.

APQ is released under the ACL or GPL licence.

If you have downloaded the binary version, you should have the spar
binary and the SparForte manual in the doc directory and sample scripts in
the examples directory.

To install SparForte as your login shell, copy the "spar" file to the
/usr/local/bin directory (or type "make install" to do this for you).
Then change the /etc/passwd file accordingly.  Alternatively, change
/etc/shells to allow users to select spar as a shell with chsh.
You will need to be the superuser to copy or edit these files.

If you have downloaded the SparForte sources, the INSTALL file contains
instructions for compiling the sources.

"Have a lot of fun!"
