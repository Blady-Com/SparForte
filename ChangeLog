CHANGES SINCE 2.3

1. Fix: The prompt script now reports any errors when it runs.  The prompt script uses the default prompt on an error instead of being a blank string.

2. New: new example scripts: git_prompt_script,

3. Fix: missing files with 2> and 2>> now reported as an error.  (<, > and >> were working properly).

4. Fix: file paths for redirection may not immediately follow a redirection (no longer require a space).
