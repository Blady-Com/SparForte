Bush 1.1 is a bug fix release.

The issue numbers below refer to the Bush 2.0 (After 1.0.3) Change Log on
the Business Shell web forums.  These have already been done in the unfinished
Bush 2.0 and are being back-ported to version 1.0.x.


New Features

Configuration file improvements, including auto-detection of the correct calendar package
and support for alpha and cygwin (though cygwin may require unavailable packages to
compile--full cygwin support is in Bush 2.0).

Additional sample programs included.

27. pragma inspection_peek is like pragma inspection_point except it never breaks to the debugger, even if --break is used. 

36. pragma annotate now accepts the following annotation fields as the first parameter: author, created, description, errors, modified, param, return, see also, summary. 

45. help -m/-h - actually added earlier, help now displays HTML or UNIX man page output with these flags for scripts. This is for document generation with pragma annotate.

59. New: unset removes subcomponents of aggregate types (arrays and records).

62. New: 64-bit support for pen (libSDL) package.


Bug Fixes

5. arrays.first and arrays.last no longer report spurious type errors while exiting a block or loop. 

17. The main program identifier is no longer considered a keyword. 

18. arrays.reverse is now arrays.flip to avoid a conflict with the Ada reserved word reverse. 

26. pragma debug now runs the debug statements in restricted shell mode.

49. Bug Fix: Order of Ada-style command parameters no longer reversed. That is, echo("A","B") now displays "A B" not "B A".

47. Fixed: file descriptor leak when opening sockets. 

50. Fixed: Case statement no longer locks up script when the script is exiting.

51. Fixed: ParseShellWord no longer locks up script when the script is exiting.

52. Fixed: Shell commands now return status code in $? or os.status.

53  Changes to eliminate several spurious compiler warnings.

54. Fixed: An error when running a script now returns an error code instead of 0 (success).

55. Fixed: Declaring procedures/functions no longer throw unexplained exceptions.

56. Change: case statement now allows constants as a selector, which is good because Bush subprogram parameters are treated as constants.

57. Fixed: command type re-enabled.

58. Fixed: env displays procedure and function types correctly.

60. Fixed: pen.move_to now moves absolutely instead of relatively.

61. Fixed: uniary (+,-,not) operations can now be used in front of subexpressions.

63. Text_IO Open accepts an expression for the filename, no longer throws exception on $1
