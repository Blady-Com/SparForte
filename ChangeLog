SparForte 1.4's focus was on REST, DB, OpenGL

KNOWN BUGS

- integer type casting is not working on parameters
- freebsd rounding of 2.5 fails because freebsd rounds down instead of up (FreeBSD Ada bug??)

CHANGES SINCE 1.3

1. New: RPM spec for Red Hat builds.

2. Fix: numerics.even no longer requires extra parenthesis.

3. Fix: numerics.hash_of, sdbm_hash_of, fnv_hash_of, murmur_hash_of no longer
throw an exception on a number instead of a string as the first parameter.

4. Fix: FreeBSD 9 support.

5. Fix: AdaVox discriminant error on newer Ada compilers corrected.

6. Fix: EINTR handling on one line was for 64-bit now works with 32-bit also.

7. New: started pen OpenGL capabilities by defining OpenGL constants.

8. Fix: boolean shortcut no longer runs on lines that are not executing
[check].

9. Fix: Kudge for division by zero bug found in GCC Ada 4.7.1.  Dividing by zero now throws an exception again.

10. New: Raspberry Pi / ARM6l support in configure script.

11. Change: gstreamer replaces ADAVOX OSS for sound package.

12. New: Pragma block. Pragma is...end pragma.

13. New: Pragma chains.  Pragmas may be chained using @, both stand-alone pragmas and pragma blocks.

14. New: Example program: weave.sp

15. Change: pragma debug no longer strips a final end-of-line.  put_line and put now work normally, not as they would in a backquote literal.

16. Fix: pragma debug - source_info and error messages now use the enclosing script's line number, rather than the backquotes script line number (e.g. line 1).  This makes source_info useful in pragma debug.  The character count in errors is still counted from the first backquote.

17. Fix: backquote literals - source_info and error messages now use the enclosing script's line number, rather than the backquotes script line number (e.g. line 1).  The character count in errors is still counted from the first backquote.

18. Fix: Bourne shell command immediately following 'else' are no longer treated as Ada format.

19. New: Unused variables are not permitted.  In --test mode, most unused identifiers are not permitted.  Does not affect unused record fields or enumerated types and their items (see next item).

20. New: pragma restriction( no_unused_identifiers );  In --test mode, require that all enumerated items and type names are explicitly used.

21. Fix: out record parameters no longer allocate a new record for an existing record.

22. New: Basic exception handlers implemented.  Reraising exceptions. Not completely negative tested.

23. New: Style checks on identifiers.  Apply only in specific contexts.

24. Fix: strings.split, numerics.set_re, numerics.set_im,memcache.new_cluster, memcache.get, memcache.version, memcache.stats (and highreads) now classed as a procedure, not a function.  pen.inside_rect, pen.in_rect, pen.greyscale, directory_operations.dir_separator now classed as a function not a procedure.

25. Fix: mysql.clear, mysql.will_rollback_on_finalize, mysql.is_trace, db.clear, db.will_rollback_on_finalize, db.is_trace no longer run during a syntax check.

26. Fix: mysql.tuples returns mysql.tuple_count_type as documented, not a natural.  db.tuples returns db.tuple_count_type as document, not a natural.

27. Fix: backported some fixes from APQ 3.0 to APQ 2.1.  Fixed closed trace file bugs, disconnect/reconnect bug and several others.

28. Fix: global profiles work correctly.  (A line was mistakenly deleted in source code at some point.)

29. Fix: stats package functions now appear as functions not procedures (this did not affect their execution).

30. Fix: pen.get_pen_brush existed but wasn't visible.  Now is visible.

31. Change: profile files and include files are now checked that they are not empty, not world-readable.

32. Fix: command_line.argument_count now returns a natural as documenteded, not a universal numeric. command_name now returns a string as document, not a universal string.

33. New: mysqlm package, mysql with multiple connections.  New mysqlm.fetch_values procedure.

34. Change: Most built-in procedures and some functions now run using callbacks which should run slightly faster.

35. Fix: mysql.list now limits output to the current database, has fixed table type and engine layout and has been upgraded to show info properly for newer versions of MySQL and MariaDB.

36. Fix: assignments and user-defind subprogram parameters for integer subtypes (integer, positive, natural) to be assigned to the larger ranged integer type.

37. New: mysqlm.append_for_insert and mysqlm.append_for_update procedures that take a record as a parameter.

38. New: directory_operations.open, close, is_open, read.  New data type directory_operations.dir_file_id.

39. New: style check: variable expansions must be in double quotes (with the exception of $?, $$, etc).  New pragma suppress( word_quoting ) will disable this check.

40. Change: positive and natural are now subtypes of integer.
