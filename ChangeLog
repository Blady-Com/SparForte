SparForte 2.0's focus was on symbol table changes to support packages, and extending the maximum number of reserved words so more keywords can be defined.

CHANGES SINCE 2.0

1. New: in --test phase mode, variables that are not written to (that is, assigned to or are in out / out parameters) are an error: they should be constants.  If a record field is written to, the whole record is treated as written to.

2. Change: Release tests now test example programs with --test phase mode (instead of the default development phase mode) to ensure the most error checking is applied.  (Also, they really are being tested for a release so --test is the correct flag.)

3. Change: Additional debugging options on GCC C compiles.

4. Fix: for GNU readline prompt, added a newline so "return" displays properly on control-d exit.

5. Change: New, more meaningful message when a -- or comment hides last semi-colon at a command prompt.

6. New: pragma annotate( category ... ) to designate a group of scripts.

7. New: --profile / -P - run profile without logging in or using --login.

8. Fix: Control-C/SIGINT no longer aborts an interactive session if pragma prompt_script has been used.

9. Fix: Clear login shell flag on background processes in pipelines so they don't report a "must use logout" error.  Hopefully fixed, anyway.

10. Fix: removed EINTR handling on close...this is a diagnosic message and should not result in another close attempt.

11. Fix: env no longer raises PROGRAM_ERROR due to broken pipe (e.g. env | head ).

12. Fix: Added a SIGPIPE handler.  The results are ignored but it prevents broken pipe warnings from other commands (e.g. ls -1 | head ).
