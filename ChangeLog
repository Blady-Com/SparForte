SparForte 2.0.2's focus was bug fixes for SparForte 2.0.1

CHANGES SINCE 2.0.1

1. Fix: When the verbose option is used, Berkeley DB verbose options are enabled for DB_VERB_BACKUP, DB_VERB_DEADLOCK, DB_VERB_FILEOPS, DB_VERB_WAITSFOR.

2. Fix: If btree_io.create fails to create a file, an exception is no longer raised when truncate is attempted.

3. Fix: Dynamic memory within resource handles is freed and files closed prior to deallocation the resource handle.

4. Fix: In web templates, scripts tags are no longer run if a previous error occurred.  The error flag is not reset either, so errors will appear in the browser window.

5. Fix: btree_io.remove no longer throws an exception when a cursor isn't used (uninitialized variable).
