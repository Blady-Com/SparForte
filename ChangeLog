CHANGES SINCE 2.2

1. Fix: The PWD variable value is always revised when SparForte (or, at least, the scanner) starts.  This prevents an exported PWD variable from another shell confusion SparForte.

2. Fix: The job control messages now only display in interactive or breakout sessions (unless hidden for another reason).

3. Fix: The strings.csv_field function is more in line with RFC 4180.  CR+LF line ending no longer returned on the last field.  Single quotes flag.

4. Fix: using equals for assignment gives an error message to use := instead.

5. Fix: get_line no longer reports an end-of-file when reading the last line of a file that doesn't have a newline.

6. Fix: --break once again shows the line where the execution stopped.

7. (Cameron Y) Change: test phase mode (--test) replaces development phase mode as the default.  Use development phase mode (--coding) to change to development phase.

8. New: strings.perl_match() performs PCRE library regular expressions.  PCRE now required for building SparForte. [tests needed]

CHANGES SINCE 2.2.1

9. Fix: using a built-in procedure as a function shows an appropriate error message rather than raising an exception.

10. Fix: using a built-in function as a shell command shows an appropriate error message rather than saying it's a field of a record type.

11. Fix: strings.perl_match() now works correctly.

12. Fix: removed "sourceFiles:" debugging statement from breakout prompt.

CHANGES SINCE 2.2.2

13. New: parameterized (generic) types can now be extended as types and subtypes or passed as parameters to user subprograms

14. New: parameterized (generic) types can now be defined as types and subtypes.  These types and subtypes can be passed as parameters to user subprograms.  Types extending resource types must be limited.

15. Change: record declarations may end with "end <type-name>" instead of "end record", but only if pragma ada_95 is not used. [tests needed]

16. New: function and procedure forward specifications. [docs needed].

17. Fix: multiple library paths (-L option) now work correctly.

18. Fix: trying to run a "with separate" file now produces an appropriate error message.

19. Fix: -p option now showing functions, procedures, blocks correctly.

20: New: -p option shows number of comments and comments/block statistics. (may be fooled by -- in strings).

21. New: -p option shows number of branches and branches/block statistics.

22. Change: As a security precaution, the trace command, and pragma inspect, inspection_peek and inspection_point are no longer allowed in testing or maintenance phases unless at the breakout prompt.  Tracing can be invoked by the command line options.

23. Change: As a security precaution, JSON error message have values do not appear when in maintenance mode.

24. New: --without-pcre configuration option will disable PCRE library support.

25. Change: a script will not run for the same permission issues as an include file.

26. Fix: script file name fix if the error messages where it was appending file suffixes.

27. New: constant specifications (i.e. forward constants).

28. Fix: tests for now ignore deleted identifiers within the symbol table.  Before, only deleted identifiers on the top of the symbol table were ignored.

29. Change: strings.image handles enumerated items.

30. Fix: failed assignments to array variables or anonymous array variables during declaration will delete the half-declared variable.

31. Fix: backquotes handled correctly in a shell word when the backquotes are not the first item in the word.

32. [Fedja B] Change: If Git exists, configure will use Git to create the build version string attached to the development command prompt.  Otherwise, the current date is used as before.

33. [Marek K] New: New directory function.

34. [Marek K] Change: Changes to support Ubuntu 19.10.

35. New: help command now supports -h and -m to produce HTML and Groff (man page) output for internal help topics.

36. Fix: certain checks for readable and executable files now handle root and gid groups better.

37. Change: help for scripts now rendered with the same report class as the built-in topics.

38. New: New annotations: content, examples, exceptions, footer.

39. New: pragma manual_test, pragma manual_test_result for manual testing.

40. Change: For security, the directory containing the current script, with separate files, local profile, global profile, global policy or global config file must be readable and not world writable.  This follows Perl and Ruby (taint mode).

41. Fix: concrete vs abstract error on a type of array elements but is never otherwise used is fixed.

42. [Pascal B] Fix: Additional error checking enabled on Ada compiler.  Several new errors, mostly harmless and related to static code analysis, have been fixed.

43. [Pascal B] Fix: Fixed various static code analysis errors on sample programs as a part of testing item 42.

44. Fix: Copying volatiles no longer results in conflicting error messages.
