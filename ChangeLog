CHANGES SINCE 2.2

1. Fix: The PWD variable value is always revised when SparForte (or, at least, the scanner) starts.  This prevents an exported PWD variable from another shell confusion SparForte.

2. Fix: The job control messages now only display in interactive or breakout sessions (unless hidden for another reason).

3. Fix: The strings.csv_field function is more in line with RFC 4180.  CR+LF line ending no longer returned on the last field.  Single quotes flag.
