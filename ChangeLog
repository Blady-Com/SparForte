4. New: exception handlers accept exception names.

5. New: raise command (beside re-raising in handlers).  The exception may be followed by "with" and a message, as in Ada 2005.  The extension is not allowed with pragma ada_95.

6. New: exceptions package.  exceptions.exception_name, exceptions.exception_info, exceptions.exception_status_code.

7. New: style issue: large indentations now reported as an error. 

8. New: environment variable TABSIZE can change the number of spaces for a tab from the default 8 to a different number.

9. New chains package.  chains.chain_count, chains.chain_context, chains.in_chain.

10. New doubly_linked_list package: new_list, clear, is_empty, length, append, prepend, first_element, last_element, delete_first, delete_last, new_cursor, first, last, next, previous, element, replace_element, insert_before, insert_before_and_mark, delete, contains, find, reverse_find, reverse_elements flip, assign, move, swap, swap_links, splice, has_element, assemble, disasemble

11. Fix: SMTP sanitizes output, provides timestamp. [testing needed] [timezone handling needed]

New: dynamic_hash_tables package.   dynamic_hash_tables.new_table,  dynamic_hash_tables.set, dynamic_hash_tables.reset, dynamic_hash_tables.get, dynamic_hash_tables.has_element, dynamic_hash_tables.remove, dynamic_hash_tables.get_first, dynamic_hash_tables.get_next, dynamic_hash_tables.add, dynamic_hash_tables.replace, dynamic_hash_tables.append, dynamic_hash_tables.prepend, dynamic_hash_tables.increment, dynamic_hash_tables.decrement.  

13. New: type and subtype can create derived array types.

14. Fix: optional template file paths now working again.

15. Fix: errors processing template files are now being displayed again.

16. Fix: processing template files with a main program does not discard the main program variables prior to processing the template.

17. Fix: extra newline no longer appears when <?spar tag is at the end of line in a template file.

17. Fix: unused variable checks suppressed for scripts with templates.

18. New Examples: dynamic_css and dynamic_css2.

19. Change: in debug mode, cgi scripts will show HTML error messages, not just templates, provided they errors occur after pragma template / unrestricted_template.

20. Change: in debug mode, cgi script HTML error messages have been updated to a more modern look using CSS styling.

21. Fix: templates no longer run if the main script has an error.

22. Change: cgi script HTML error messages appear in all software development cycle settings except maintenance, or debug mode, or maintnance plus debug mode.  The message has been updated to newer HTML standards.  gcc-style errors is now selectable: it affects the display on the web page but errors logged to the server will still be gcc-style.

23. Change: different cgi script templates produce error messages in formats suitable for the template type.  Same for exceptions.

24. Fix: raise at the end of a simple script no longer causes an unreachable code error. [can this be restored after the other changes I made?]

25. Fix: uninitialized numeric variables no longer crash "?" but are reported as an approprate error.

26. Change: uninitialized variables in expressions now give an unitialized variable error messages instead of general "exception raised" error message.

27. Fix: end of script warnings (like pragma deprecated/depreciated) now appear as messages when template files are used.

28. Fix: deleteIdent function refactored to eliminate inconsistent variable exporting.

29. New: session variables callbacks.  pragma session_import_script, pragma session_export_script, new session import/export type. [tests needed]

30. New: array variables may be deleted with unset.  However, anonymous array types will linger until the end of block.

31. New: teams package.  Contains the teams.member record.

32. New: teamwork pragmas.  pragma advise, blocked, clarify, dispute, propose, refactor.

33. Fix: fixed more problems with variable exporting when a block is pulled.

34. Change: uninitialized connections and queries in mysqlm give a meaningful error message instead of throwing an exception.

35. Change: style issues for non-meaningful names expanded to include amount, const, func, info, input, output, parm/s, param/s, proc,variable and variables.  Left result in.

36. Fix: previous help options no longer linger to another help command invocation.

37. help -t shows todo pragmas and summary of work. help -c shows teamwork pragmas.

38. Fix: pathname expansion of shell words no longer double slash when the directory is a single slash.

39. Fix: pathname expansion of tilde no longer intermittently happens in the middle of a shell word.

40. New: teams package has a new work priority type: work_priority.cvss

41. New: pragma todo's checked during late SDLC stages.

42. New: pragma suppress( low_priority_todos_for_release ) and suppress( all_todos_for_release ).  Allow low-priority todo's in late SDLC stages.  New teams_priority.completed priority.

43. Fix: Using @ with ? no longer results in an infinite loop, locking up SparForte.

44. Change: Example programs updated: chomp, chomp2, count_statements, factorial, fibonacci, filecopy, file_creation, int_sort, roman_numerals.

45. Fix: shell and http_cgi variables no longer try to save value when exported variable is destroyed.

46. New: /etc/sparforte_policy file for global script architecture policies.

47: Fix: error messages for include/policy file permissions no longer say "include file" but make clear what file has the permission issues.

48. Fix: compilation errors when disabling all database types during configuration fixed.

49. New: New example programs opengl_first (created earlier), opengl_second (created earlier), randdev, randuni.

50. Fix: "; @" in a pragma chain no longer puts the interpreter into an infinite loop, now reports correct error.
