SparForte 2.1.1's focus was bringing SparForte into Jenkins continuous integration.

CHANGES SINCE 2.1

1. New: Can now subtract one calendar.time value from another.

2. New: New examples: game_24.sp, string_prepend.sp, sumseries.sp, sumsq.sp, ternary_logic.sp, twelve_days.sp, time_function.sp

3. Fix: Anonymous array element type is treated as applied to eliminate concrete/abstract error.

4. New: OS package functions.  os.pid, equivalent to Bourne shell $$. os.error_string (strerror) and documentation fixed.

5. Fix: instead of "identifier not declared", now get "too few parameter" when calling a user function with too few parameters.  Might be a more efficient way to implement this.

6. New: abstract procedures and subprograms.

7. Fix: functions without a return value statement produce an error.

8. New: limited arrays, records and anonymous arrays.

9. Fix: re-raise fixed to work in if statements in an exception handler.

10. New: "nonstandard" software model.

11. Fix: variables with explicit limited qualifier are now limited.  limited renames. [Doc/tests required]

12. New: return statements may have a when clause, like an exit statement.

13. Refactor: constants are no longer a separate identifier class from variables.  constant is now an identifier usage qualifier like limited and abstract and can be applied to any identifier class.  constants are now variables with a usage of "constant". [tests, docs to update]

14. Change: command variables must now be limited instead of constant, in line with new limited functionality.  They cannot be used in an expression or assigned to.

15. New: at debug prompt, limited variables, like constants, may be assigned a value but will report a warning.
