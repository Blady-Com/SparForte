BUSH (Business Shell) Installation

This file contains instructions for building and installing BUSH.
General information about BUSH can be found in the BUSH User Guide.


SHORT VERSION

Installing the Binary Version

   1. gmake install

Building from Sources

   1. configure
   2. gmake
   3. gmake test (optional)
   4. gmake install (as root user)


LONG VERSION

The primary test plaform for BUSH is Intel/Linux and AMD/Linux.  There
is also some support for DEC Alpha, FreeBSD and Cywin.  HP-UX 
is obsolete.

Information on porting BUSH to other platforms can be found in the BUSH User
Guide: BUSH should port to a modern Unix-compatible platform within a few
hours by creating a bush_os interface file based on the standard C libraries
for your operating system.  Please contribute new bush_os files to the BUSH
project.


REQUIREMENTS

We have attempted to avoid re-inventing existing functionality wherever
possible and tried to keep the dependency list reasonably small, but it
still may be challenging for an inexperienced user to build and install
BUSH from sources.  Most users are probably better served by using binary
packages from their distributor, if they are available.

The following software packages are required for BUSH:

  * GNU make is required; other make programs may not work.  GNU make is often
    installed under the name "gmake" and the BUSH makefile assumes this is the
    name of your software building program.

  * GCC is required; BUSH is written in Ada and C, both of which are available
    with GCC 3.x or later.  If you are running GCC 2.x, use add-on Ada compiler
    GNAT 3.15.  Most modern Linux distributions, including Red Hat,  have
    GCC 3.x with Ada and C support active or available from an online
    repository.

  * gzip is needed to unpack the source code in the first place.  If you are
    reading this, you know this already.

  * postgresql is a required database engine for BUSH.  To verify that postgres
    is installed, try "psql --version".  For more information, visit
    http://www.postgresql.org.

  * mysql is also required for this version.  A future version will make one
    or both databases optional.

  * SDL (Simple DirectMedia Layer) library and SDL_image

  These may not be installed on your operating system, or some components
  may be missing.  How you install these depends on your operating system.
  For example:

   - Fedora/Red Hat/Linux - yum install package-name (or use add/remove
     software in the menus)
   - SuSE/Novell/Linux - yast
   - Debian/Linux - apt-get install package-name (visit packages.debian.org
     for a list of available packages)
   - FreeBSD - pkg_add package-name

  The package name depends on your operating system.  For example:

    - Debian Linux users can try gnat-3.3 (or similar)
    - Fedora Linux users can try gcc-gnat
    - SuSE Linux   users can try gcc-ada

  Example: Debian Linux 3.1

  The default Debian database is PostgreSQL.  However, Debian doesn't
  install Ada, SDL, MySQL or the PostgreSQL development packages.  Check
  packages.debian.org for a list of software package names.

  $ apt-get install gnat-3.3
  $ apt-get install libncurses5-dev
  $ apt-get install libsdl1.2-dev
  $ apt-get install libsdl-image1.2
  $ apt-get install libpgeasy-dev
  $ apt-get install mysql-server
  $ apt-get install libmysqlclient12-dev

  Update the locate database: Debian uses a static Ada Run-Time file so BUSH
  will need to use locate instead of ldconfig to find it.  (Running updatedb
  is safe even if this was not true.)

  $ updatedb

  SDL_image is installed but the filename contains the version number so
  BUSH can't see it.  Create a symbolic link to the standard name.

  $ ln -s /usr/lib/libSDL_image-1.2.so.0.1.3 (or similar) /usr/lib/libSDL_image.so
  $ ldconfig



INSTALLATION

The latest version of BUSH is always located at the PegaSoft web site,
http://www.pegasoft.ca.

1. configure

   The first step of the installation procedure is to select your operating
   system.  Run "configure" and the configure script will identify your
   operating system and create a new file called "bush_os.ads" containing the
   binding for your system calls.

   configure will also check for the basic tools needed to build BUSH
   (including an Ada compiler).  When it is finished configuring BUSH,
   configure will run the configure programs for the ADAVOX and APQ third-
   party libraries used by BUSH. The APQ configuration script will ask
   questions about your database software.  (Note: BUSH currently supports
   PostgreSQL and MySQL.)

   configure recognizes the following environment variables:

    - ARCH - this will override the machine processor architecture (normally
             determined by uname -p)
    - GMAKE - use this to specify a path to GNU make if it cannot be found

2. make

   Use GNU make to build BUSH.  Linux users can just type "make" or "make all".
   If GNU make is not your native make (e.g. FreeBSD), use "gmake".

   If you see "ld: cannot find -lx" where x is a library name:

   This means the linker cannot find a library file (usually libx.so where
   x is a library name, but this depends on your operating system).

   There are several possible reasons for this.

   Either (1) You will need to install additional packages.  For example,
   you installed a database server without the development files.

   (2) Your operating system has a different name for x, typically with
   a version number attached to the name.  This happens frequently with
   SDL_image although it can happen with other libraries as well.

   First, do a search using the "find" or "locate" commands to determine if
   you have the library installed.  If not, install it.  If it exists but
   has a different name, following the Debian example above: use "ln" to
   create a link and ldconfig to register the alternative name for the
   library.

   (3) You've installed the package but need to run "ldconfig" to refresh
   the linker's database and add the names of the new libraries.

   (4) The libraries are stored in an unusual location and a "-L" switch
   must be added to the src/GNUmakefile specifying where the libraries are
   found.  Some packages have a "config" program to determine the proper
   settings, such as "SDL_config", "pg_config" or "mysql_config".

3. (Optional) "gmake test" to run the bush regression tests.  This make take
   several minutes.

4. (Optional) "gmake install" will copy the bush executable to the
   /usr/local/bin/ directory so that other users can access it.  Alteratively,
   you can copy the bush executable and man page yourself and set the
   appropriate permission bits.

You can now run the bush executable.

Type "gmake help" for a list of all options.  There are more options in the
src directory makefile.
